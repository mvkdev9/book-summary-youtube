**Title:** Making Smarter Decisions When You Don't Have All the Facts: *Thinking in Bets*

**Introduction**
Annie Duke, a former professional poker player, argues that life is not like chess (where all pieces are visible); it is like poker (where hidden information and luck play a huge role). To make better decisions, we must stop seeing the world in black and white and start "thinking in bets."

**Key Insights**
1.  **Resulting:** The mistake of judging a decision by its outcome. A good decision can lead to a bad result (bad luck), and a bad decision can lead to a good result (dumb luck).
2.  **Probability vs. Certainty:** Stop saying "I'm sure." Start saying "I'm 70% sure." This invites feedback and allows for error.
3.  **Wanna Bet?** When you frame a belief as a bet, you become more objective. You start looking for why you might be wrong.
4.  **Hindsight Bias:** The feeling that a result was inevitable after it happened. It wasn't.
5.  **Tilt:** In poker, 'tilt' is when emotion takes over. In life, we must recognize our 'tilt' and step away from the table.

**Conclusion**
Success is not about being right every time. It’s about making the best possible decisions based on the odds.

**Title:** How to Think Like a Poker Pro (Annie Duke Summary)

**[0:00-2:00] Life is Poker, Not Chess**
*   **Host:** "Most people think life is like chess. If you make the right move, you win. If you lose, you made a mistake. But Annie Duke, a world-class poker player, says life is Poker. You can make the perfect move and still lose. You can make a terrible move and win. Today we learn how to *Think in Bets*."

**[2:00-5:00] Resulting: The Bias of the Scoreboard**
*   **Host:** "Duke calls it 'Resulting.' Imagine you drive home drunk and you make it safely. Was that a good decision? Of course not. It was a terrible decision with a lucky outcome. We judge our lives by the scoreboard, but the scoreboard is often lying to us. Focus on the *process*, not the *result*."

**[5:00-7:30] The Magic Words: "I'm 60% sure"**
*   **Host:** "Stop using 100%. When you say 'I'm 100% sure,' you close your mind. If you say 'I'm 60% sure,' you admit there is room for error. This makes you more humble, more open to new info, and less likely to be 'wrong' in your own eyes."

**[7:30-9:00] wanna Bet?**
*   **Host:** "This is the ultimate accountability tool. Next time you state an opinion, ask yourself: 'Would I bet \$100 on this?' Suddenly, you'll start looking for the flaws in your own logic. You'll become your own devil's advocate."

**[9:00-10:00] Conclusion**
*   **Host:** "Life is a series of bets. Stop chasing certainty and start calculating the odds."

**Script 1: Stop Resulting**
*   **Audio:** "Why do we judge our choices by the outcome? Annie Duke calls this 'Resulting.' If you buy a lottery ticket and win, it doesn't mean it was a smart financial move. It means you got lucky. Stop beating yourself up for bad results if you made a good decision. And stop praising yourself for good results if you just got lucky. Focus on the process."

**Script 2: Life is Poker**
*   **Audio:** "Life is not like chess. In chess, there is no luck and all the information is on the board. Life is like poker. You have hidden information and a massive amount of luck. You can do everything right and still fail. The goal isn't to be perfect; the goal is to make the best bet with the information you have. Play the odds, not the outcome."

**Script 3: Confident Humility**
*   **Audio:** "Stop saying 'I know.' Start saying 'I'm 70% sure.' When you attach a percentage to your beliefs, you change your brain. You acknowledge that you might be wrong. You invite other people to help you find the truth. Certainty is the enemy of learning. Probability is the language of winners."

**Script 4: Wanna Bet?**
*   **Audio:** "Want to know if someone is full of it? Ask them: 'Wanna bet?' It changes everything. When money is on the line, people stop being 'opinionated' and start being 'objective.' They check their facts. They look for the holes in their story. Use the 'Wanna Bet' filter on your own thoughts to find the truth."

**Script 5: The Hindsight Trap**
*   **Audio:** "We are all geniuses after the fact. It’s called Hindsight Bias. After a game or a stock market crash, we say 'I knew that would happen!' No, you didn't. You're just ignoring the infinite other possibilities that *could* have happened. Hindsight makes us overconfident. Stay humble and remember that the future is always uncertain."
