**Title:** What I Learned Living with David Goggins (Jesse Itzler Summary)

**[0:00-2:00] The Hire**
*   **Host:** "Jesse Itzler was a millionaire living in a penthouse. He felt bored. He saw a Navy SEAL at a 24-hour race and was terrified by him. So he did the only logical thing: He paid the SEAL to live with him for a month. The only rule? 'I do everything you say.'"

**[2:00-5:00] Day One**
*   **Host:** "Day one, 6 AM. The SEAL (David Goggins) knocks on the door. He tells Jesse to do pull-ups. Jesse does 8. He’s done. The SEAL says: 'We aren't leaving until you do 100.' It took hours. Jesse’s hands were bleeding. But he did it. This is the **40% Rule** in action."

**[5:00-7:30] The Psychology of the SEAL**
*   **Host:** "The SEAL never complained. If it was raining, he loved it. If he was hungry, he loved it. He taught Jesse that you can't control the weather, but you can control your 'Hardness.' He forced Jesse to do things that made no sense, just to break his spirit and rebuild it."

**[7:30-9:00] The Transformation**
*   **Host:** "By the end of the month, Jesse was faster, stronger, and more importantly, he was mentally 'Unfuckwithable.' He realized that his life was too easy. He needed the 'Struggle' to feel alive."

**[9:00-10:00] Conclusion**
*   **Host:** "Go find your own SEAL. Do something today that makes you uncomfortable."

**Script 1: 100 Pull-Ups**
*   **Audio:** "Jesse Itzler could only do 8 pull-ups. Then he hired a Navy SEAL. The SEAL told him to do 100. Jesse said 'I can't.' The SEAL said 'We aren't leaving this room until you do.' It took hours, but he did it. The lesson? You aren't limited by your muscles; you are limited by your mind. Your 'limit' is just a lie you told yourself."

**Script 2: The 40% Rule (Jesse Itzler)**
*   **Audio:** "When your brain says 'Stop, I'm tired,' it’s a survival mechanism. It’s trying to save energy. But you actually have 60% more in the tank. This is the 40% Rule. To find your true potential, you have to ignore the voice that wants to quit. Push past the first wall of pain, and you'll find a second wind you never knew existed."

**Script 3: Get Uncomfortable**
*   **Audio:** "Why are you so stressed? Maybe because your life is too easy. Jesse Itzler found that when he was suffering during SEAL training, his 'normal' problems didn't matter anymore. If you want to be happy, you have to seek out discomfort. Take the cold shower. Run in the rain. When you conquer the hard stuff, the easy stuff becomes a breeze."

**Script 4: No Excuses**
*   **Audio:** "It’s 3 AM. It’s snowing. You have a meeting in 4 hours. Most people would skip the workout. The SEAL wouldn't. He taught Jesse that the conditions don't matter. The only thing that matters is the commitment you made to yourself. If you let the weather or your mood dictate your actions, you are a slave. Be the master."

**Script 5: The Power of Volume**
*   **Audio:** "You don't need a fancy workout plan. You need Volume. The SEAL made Jesse do 1000 push-ups a day. No fancy machines. Just sweat and reps. We overcomplicate success. Usually, the answer is just to do more of the basic stuff. Don't look for the hack; look for the grind."
