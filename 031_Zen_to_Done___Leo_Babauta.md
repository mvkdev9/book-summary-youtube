# Zen to Done by Leo Babauta

## 1. Long Detailed Summary for Blog

**Title:** The Simple Productivity System: *Zen to Done*

**Introduction**
Leo Babauta created *Zen to Done* (ZTD) as a reaction to *Getting Things Done* (GTD). While GTD is powerful, it can be overwhelming. ZTD focuses on **simplicity** and **habits**. It is about doing, not just organizing.

**The 10 Habits**
1.  **Collect:** Capture ideas immediately (Notebook/Phone).
2.  **Process:** Don't let things pile up. Process your inbox daily.
3.  **Plan:** Set Big Rocks for the week and 1-3 MITs (Most Important Tasks) for the day.
4.  **Do:** Focus on one task at a time without distraction.
5.  **Simple Trusted System:** Keep simple lists (Contexts, Projects). Don't overcomplicate tools.
6.  **Organize:** Put things where they belong immediately.
7.  **Review:** Weekly Review to get back on track.
8.  **Simplify:** Reduce your goals and tasks to the essentials.
9.  **Routine:** Set morning and evening routines to structure your day.
10. **Find Your Passion:** Work on things you love; you won't need as much discipline.

**Key Concepts**
*   **Minimalist Productivity:** Focus on doing the few things that matter, rather than managing a mountain of things that don't.
*   **Habit-Based:** Don't try to adopt the whole system at once. Adopt one habit at a time (e.g., just "Collect" for 30 days).

**Conclusion**
Productivity should be peaceful. ZTD strips away the complexity and leaves you with the work itself.

**Title:** GTD is Too Hard. Try Zen to Done.

**[0:00-2:00] The GTD Problem**
*   **Host:** "We all love *Getting Things Done*, but let's be honest: It's hard. The system is huge. You spend more time managing your lists than doing the work."
*   **Host:** "Leo Babauta felt the same way. So he stripped it down. He created *Zen to Done*. It’s minimalist. It’s calm. And it’s built on habits, not tools."

**[2:00-5:00] The Core Habits**
*   **Host:** "ZTD has 10 habits, but you only need the first 4 to start."
*   **Habit 1: Collect.** "Carry a notebook. Capture everything. Stop using your brain as storage."
*   **Habit 2: Process.** "Don't let your inbox rot. Make quick decisions. Delete, Delegate, Do, Defer."
*   **Habit 3: Plan.** "This is crucial. Pick 3 MITs (Most Important Tasks) for the day. Do them first."
*   **Habit 4: Do.** "Single-tasking. Turn off the phone. Close the tabs. Just do the one thing."

**[5:00-7:00] Simplify & Routine**
*   **Host:** "The magic of ZTD is Habit 8: Simplify. Reduce your commitments. Say no. If you have fewer things to do, you don't need a complex system."
*   **Host:** "And Habit 9: Routine. Create a 'launch pad' routine in the morning and a 'shutdown' routine at night. It gives your day structure."

**[7:00-9:00] One Habit at a Time**
*   **Host:** "The biggest mistake people make? Trying to change everything at once. Babauta says: Pick ONE habit. Do it for 30 days. Only then add the next. It’s a marathon, not a sprint."

**[9:00-10:00] Conclusion**
*   **Host:** "If your productivity system stresses you out, it’s broken. Try Zen to Done."

## 3. Short Form Video Scripts (30-60 Seconds)

**Script 1: MITs (Most Important Tasks)**
*   **Audio:** "Your to-do list has 20 things on it. You will only do 5. So pick the right 5. Leo Babauta calls them MITs—Most Important Tasks. Every morning, choose 1 to 3 things that *must* happen. Write them down. Do them before you check email. If you finish those, you win the day."

**Script 2: Single-Tasking**
*   **Audio:** "Multitasking is a myth. It’s just distraction. *Zen to Done* focuses on Single-Tasking. Pick one task. Clear your desk. Close your browser tabs. Set a timer. Do that one thing until it’s done. It feels slow, but it is infinitely faster than jumping around."

**Script 3: The Inbox Zero Habit**
*   **Audio:** "Is your email inbox a source of anxiety? Fix it with the 'Process' habit. Don't check email; process it. Open an email and make a decision immediately: Delete, Delegate, Do, or Defer. Never close an email without action. Touch it once. Clear the pile."

**Script 4: Simplify**
*   **Audio:** "The best productivity tip isn't an app; it's the word 'No.' *Zen to Done* teaches us to Simplify. Look at your goals. Look at your projects. Which ones don't matter? Cut them. Productivity isn't about doing more things; it's about doing the right things."

**Script 5: One Habit at a Time**
*   **Audio:** "Why do New Year's Resolutions fail? You try to change too much. ZTD says: focus on one habit at a time. Just master 'collecting ideas' for a month. Then master 'planning' for a month. Slow change sticks. Fast change crashes."
