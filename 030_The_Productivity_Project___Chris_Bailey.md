# The Productivity Project by Chris Bailey

## 1. Long Detailed Summary for Blog

**Title:** A Year of Experiments: *The Productivity Project*

**Introduction**
Chris Bailey spent a year testing every productivity hack known to man. He woke up at 5 AM, he worked 90-hour weeks, he meditated for 35 hours. *The Productivity Project* is the result.

**The Definition**
Productivity is not how much you do. It is accomplishing what you intend to do. (Intention + Attention).

**The Rule of 3**
At the start of the day, ask: "By the end of the day, what 3 things will I want to have accomplished?" This provides focus.

**Biological Prime Time**
Track your energy for 3 weeks. When are you most alert? (e.g., 10 AM - 12 PM). Protect this time for your most important work. Do admin work during your slumps (e.g., 3 PM).

**Key Concepts**
*   **The 20-Second Rule:** Make bad habits 20 seconds harder to start (remove batteries from remote). Make good habits 20 seconds easier (put gym clothes on bed).
*   **Productive Procrastination:** Doing low-value work to avoid high-value work.

**Conclusion**
Productivity is personal. Experiment to find what works for your biology.

**Title:** I Tested Every Productivity Hack (So You Don't Have To)

**[0:00-2:00] The Experiments**
*   **Host:** "Chris Bailey is the human guinea pig of productivity. He watched 296 hours of TED talks. He lived in isolation. He worked 90 hours a week."
*   **Host:** "His conclusion? Most hacks are garbage. But a few are gold. This is *The Productivity Project*."

**[2:00-5:00] The Definition of Productivity**
*   **Host:** "Productivity isn't speed. It’s Intention. If you intend to relax, and you relax, you were productive. If you intend to write, and you check email, you were unproductive."

**[5:00-7:00] The Rule of 3**
*   **Host:** "This is the best tactic. Every morning, pick 3 things. Not 10. Just 3. It forces you to prioritize. If you do those 3, you win."

**[7:00-9:00] Biological Prime Time**
*   **Host:** "We all have a rhythm. Bailey calls it BPT. Track your energy. Are you a morning lark or a night owl? Do your deep work when your energy is high. Answer emails when your energy is low. Don't swim upstream."

**[9:00-10:00] Conclusion**
*   **Host:** "Be kind to yourself. Productivity is a tool for a better life, not a stick to beat yourself with."

## 3. Short Form Video Scripts (30-60 Seconds)

**Script 1: The Rule of 3**
*   **Audio:** "Your to-do list is too long. Burn it. Use the Rule of 3. Every morning, ask: 'What 3 things do I want to have done by tonight?' Write them down. Do them. Everything else is a bonus. Clarity beats volume."

**Script 2: Biological Prime Time**
*   **Audio:** "Stop fighting your body. Find your 'Biological Prime Time.' For 3 weeks, track when you have the most energy. If it's 10 AM, schedule your hardest work then. If it's 8 PM, work then. Manage your energy, not just your time."

**Script 3: The 20-Second Rule**
*   **Audio:** "Want to break a bad habit? Make it 20 seconds harder. Take the batteries out of the remote. Unplug the Xbox. Put your phone in another room. That tiny barrier is often enough to stop the impulse. Laziness can work for you."

**Script 4: Productive Procrastination**
*   **Audio:** "You are cleaning your desk to avoid writing your report. This is 'Productive Procrastination.' It feels like work, but it's just avoidance. Recognize it. If it's not your Rule of 3, it's a distraction. Do the scary thing first."

**Script 5: Intention**
*   **Audio:** "Productivity is doing what you intended to do. If you plan to watch Netflix for 3 hours and you do it, that is productive! If you plan to work and you watch Netflix, that is unproductive. It’s about aligning action with intent."
