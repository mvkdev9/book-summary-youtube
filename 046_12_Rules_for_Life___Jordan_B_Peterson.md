**Title:** Order in Chaos: *12 Rules for Life*

**Introduction**
Jordan Peterson combines psychology, mythology, and biology to offer an antidote to chaos. Life is suffering. The goal isn't happiness; it's meaning. Meaning is found on the border between Order and Chaos.

**The Rules (Selected)**
1.  **Stand up straight with your shoulders back:** Face the world with confidence (serotonin loop).
2.  **Treat yourself like someone you are responsible for helping:** Why do you give your dog medicine but not yourself?
3.  **Make friends with people who want the best for you:** Avoid people who drag you down.
4.  **Compare yourself to who you were yesterday, not to who someone else is today:** Envy is toxic.
5.  **Do not let your children do anything that makes you dislike them:** Discipline is love.
6.  **Set your house in perfect order before you criticize the world:** Fix your own life first.
7.  **Pursue what is meaningful (not what is expedient):** Sacrifice the present for the future.
8.  **Tell the truth – or, at least, don’t lie:** Lies corrupt reality.
9.  **Assume that the person you are listening to knows something you don’t:** Be humble.
10. **Be precise in your speech:** Define the monster to defeat it.
11. **Do not bother children when they are skateboarding:** Allow risk.
12. **Pet a cat when you encounter one on the street:** Find joy in small moments.

**Conclusion**
Pick up the heaviest load you can carry. Responsibility is where meaning lives.

**Title:** Why You Need to Clean Your Room (12 Rules for Life)

**[0:00-2:00] The Lobsters**
*   **Host:** "Why does Jordan Peterson talk about lobsters? Because they have existed for 350 million years. And they run on serotonin, just like us."
*   **Host:** "When a lobster loses a fight, it slumps. When it wins, it stands tall. Rule 1: Stand up straight. Hack your biology."

**[2:00-5:00] Treat Yourself Like a Pet**
*   **Host:** "Rule 2 is weird. Why do people buy medicine for their dog and give it perfectly, but ignore their own prescriptions? Because we don't respect ourselves. We know our own flaws. Start treating yourself like a valuable person."

**[5:00-7:00] Compare Yourself to Yesterday**
*   **Host:** "Rule 4. If you compare yourself to Elon Musk, you will be depressed. Compare yourself to the idiot you were yesterday. Did you improve 1%? That is the only game you can win."

**[7:00-9:00] Clean Your Room**
*   **Host:** "Rule 6. Everyone wants to fix the climate or the economy. But they can't even keep their bedroom clean. Start small. Create order in your local environment. Then expand."

## 3. Short Form Video Scripts (30-60 Seconds)

**Script 1: Stand Up Straight**
*   **Audio:** "Stand up straight with your shoulders back. It’s not just posture; it’s psychology. Lobsters who win fights expand their bodies. Lobsters who lose shrink. When you slump, your brain thinks you are a loser, and it gives you less serotonin. When you stand tall, people treat you better, and your brain chemistry changes. Hack your confidence."

**Script 2: Compare Yourself to Yesterday**
*   **Audio:** "Stop scrolling Instagram and hating your life. Rule 4: Compare yourself to who you were yesterday, not to who someone else is today. You don't know their struggles. You only see their highlight reel. The only fair comparison is you vs. you. Are you better than you were yesterday? That is success."

**Script 3: Pursue Meaning, Not Happiness**
*   **Audio:** "Happiness is a side effect. It comes and goes. If you aim for it, you will miss. Aim for Meaning. Rule 7: Pursue what is meaningful, not what is expedient. Doing the hard thing—telling the truth, taking responsibility, working hard—creates a deep sense of purpose that sustains you through the tragedy of life."

**Script 4: Tell the Truth**
*   **Audio:** "Rule 8: Tell the truth—or at least, don't lie. Every time you lie, you weaken your character. You disconnect yourself from reality. And when reality hits (and it always does), you will be too weak to handle it. The truth burns off the dead wood. It’s painful, but it’s the only path to strength."

**Script 5: Clean Your Room**
*   **Audio:** "You want to change the world? Start by cleaning your room. If you can't even organize your own socks, how dare you try to organize the economy? Rule 6: Set your house in perfect order before you criticize the world. Fix the things within your reach. Prove you can manage the small chaos before you tackle the big chaos."
