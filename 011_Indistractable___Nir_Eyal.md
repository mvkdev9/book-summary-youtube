## 1. Long Detailed Summary for Blog

**Title:** How to Control Your Attention and Choose Your Life: *Indistractable*

**Introduction**
Nir Eyal, who previously wrote *Hooked* (about how to build habit-forming products), flips the script in *Indistractable*. He argues that distraction isn't just about technology; it’s about psychology. Distraction is an action that pulls you away from what you planned to do. Traction is an action that pulls you toward what you want to do.

**The Root Cause of Distraction**
*   **Internal Triggers:** We don't get distracted because of notifications; we get distracted to escape discomfort (boredom, anxiety, loneliness). If you don't deal with the root cause, you will find a way to be distracted even in an empty room.

**The 4 Steps to Becoming Indistractable**
1.  **Master Internal Triggers:** Learn to surf the urge. When you feel the need to check your phone, wait 10 minutes. usually, the urge passes. Reframe the task as play.
2.  **Make Time for Traction:** You can't call something a distraction unless you know what it is distracting you *from*. Timebox your day. Schedule everything, including social media and rest.
3.  **Hack Back External Triggers:** Turn off notifications. Leave group chats. Use "Do Not Disturb" aggressively. Clean up your desktop.
4.  **Prevent Distraction with Pacts:**
    *   *Effort Pact:* Make it hard to do the wrong thing (e.g., use an app blocker).
    *   *Price Pact:* Bet money on your success (e.g., "If I don't finish this chapter, I owe you $100").
    *   *Identity Pact:* Call yourself "Indistractable."

**Key Concepts**
*   **Timeboxing:** Giving every task a specific time slot.
*   **Surfing the Urge:** Not fighting the feeling of distraction, but riding it like a wave until it subsides.

**Conclusion**
Being indistractable is the skill of the century. It’s not about abstinence; it’s about intent.

**Title:** The Real Reason You Get Distracted (It's Not Your Phone)

**[0:00-1:30] Traction vs. Distraction**
*   **Host:** "We blame our phones. We blame Facebook. We blame our boss. But Nir Eyal says we are wrong. The opposite of distraction isn't focus; it's *Traction*."
*   **Host:** "Traction is any action that moves you towards what you really want. Distraction is anything that pulls you away. If you sit down to play video games and that’s what you *planned* to do, that’s Traction. If you sit down to work and check email, that’s Distraction. Today, we become *Indistractable*."

**[1:30-4:00] Step 1: Master Internal Triggers**
*   **Host:** "Here is the uncomfortable truth: You don't check your phone because it beeped. You check it because you are bored, anxious, or lonely. Distraction is an unhealthy escape from bad feelings."
*   **Host:** "Step 1 is Mastering Internal Triggers. When you feel the urge to switch tasks, stop. Wait 10 minutes. 'Surf the Urge.' Most cravings last only a few minutes. If you can ride the wave, you stay in control."

**[4:00-6:00] Step 2: Make Time for Traction**
*   **Host:** "You can't say you got distracted if you didn't know what you were supposed to be doing. You need a schedule. Not a to-do list—a timebox."
*   **Host:** "Plan every minute of your day. If you want to scroll TikTok for an hour, fine! Schedule it. '8:00 PM to 9:00 PM: TikTok.' Then it’s not a distraction; it’s traction. But when it’s work time, you work."

**[6:00-8:00] Step 3: Hack Back External Triggers**
*   **Host:** "Now we deal with the pings. Turn off all non-human notifications. If it’s not a text from a real person, you don't need it on your lock screen. Use 'Do Not Disturb' while working. Tell your colleagues, 'I am offline for 2 hours.' Hack back."

**[8:00-10:00] Step 4: Prevent with Pacts**
*   **Host:** "Finally, make a pact. An Effort Pact makes it hard to leave (like using an app that blocks the internet). A Price Pact puts money on the line. If you don't go to the gym, you have to burn a $100 bill. That will motivate you."
*   **Host:** "Become Indistractable. Choose your life."

## 3. Short Form Video Scripts (30-60 Seconds)

**Script 1: The Root Cause**
*   **Audio:** "Your phone isn't the problem. You are. Nir Eyal argues that distraction is just an escape from discomfort. You check Instagram not because you care about the photos, but because you are bored or stressed at work. If you don't deal with the internal trigger—the bad feeling—you will always find a way to be distracted, even without a phone."

**Script 2: Traction vs. Distraction**
*   **Audio:** "What is the opposite of Distraction? It's not Focus. It's *Traction*. Traction is any action that pulls you towards what you planned to do. Distraction is anything that pulls you away. So, playing video games can be Traction if you planned it! And checking email can be Distraction if you planned to write a report. Intent is everything."

**Script 3: Timeboxing**
*   **Audio:** "Throw away your to-do list. It’s making you fail. Use 'Timeboxing' instead. Give every task a specific slot on your calendar. 'Write report: 9 AM to 11 AM.' If it’s not on the calendar, it doesn't exist. You can't say you got distracted if you didn't know what you were supposed to be doing in that specific minute."

**Script 4: The 10-Minute Rule**
*   **Audio:** "Feel the urge to check your phone? Use the 10-Minute Rule. Tell yourself, 'I can check my phone, but not right now. I have to wait 10 minutes.' Usually, the urge is just a wave of anxiety or boredom. If you wait 10 minutes, the wave passes, and you can get back to work without giving in."

**Script 5: Identity Pacts**
*   **Audio:** "The most powerful way to change is to change your identity. Stop saying 'I have a short attention span.' Start saying 'I am Indistractable.' When you label yourself, you act in accordance with that label. Vegetarians don't eat meat. You don't get distracted. Be the person you say you are."
