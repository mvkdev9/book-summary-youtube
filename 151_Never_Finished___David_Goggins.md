**Title:** Why Success is Your Biggest Enemy (Never Finished Summary)

**[0:00-2:00] The Danger of Success**
*   **Host:** "David Goggins became famous. He became rich. He became a hero. And he says that was the most dangerous time of his life. Why? Because success makes you soft. Today we look at his new book, *Never Finished*."

**[2:00-5:00] The Mental Lab**
*   **Host:** "Goggins doesn't care about your 'motivation.' He cares about your 'Mental Lab.' You have to study your own failures like a scientist. Why did you quit? What were you thinking in that second? You have to dissect your own mind to rewire it."

**[5:00-7:30] The Disciple**
*   **Host:** "Discipline is the only thing that matters. Not talent, not luck. Goleman says you have to be a 'Disciple of Discipline.' That means doing the work when you're injured, when you're tired, and when you're successful. If you only work when you feel like it, you are an amateur."

**[7:30-9:00] Being Uncommon**
*   **Host:** "It’s easy to be great for a day. It’s hard to be great for a decade. Goggins argues that the world is designed to make you average. To be 'uncommon,' you have to reject the standard life. You have to be willing to be the person who stays when everyone else leaves."

**[9:00-10:00] Conclusion**
*   **Host:** "The war never ends. You are never finished."

**Script 1: Success is a Trap**
*   **Audio:** "The most dangerous moment in your life is the day after you win. Why? Because you stop being hungry. You start believing your own hype. David Goggins says: 'Success is a slow poison.' It makes you comfortable. It makes you soft. If you want to stay at the top, you have to forget you ever won and start back at zero every morning. Stay hungry."

**Script 2: The Mental Lab**
*   **Audio:** "Your mind is a laboratory. When you fail, don't just get depressed. Go into the lab. Analyze the data. What did the voice in your head say right before you quit? What was the physical sensation? When you treat your life like a science experiment, you remove the emotion and you find the solution. Be the scientist of your own soul."

**Script 3: Discipline is a Religion**
*   **Audio:** "Motivation is a feeling. It comes and goes. Discipline is a religion. It’s a set of rules you follow regardless of how you feel. If you only work when you're 'inspired,' you'll never achieve anything great. The greats are the ones who show up when they hate the work. Become a disciple of discipline."

**Script 4: The Foxhole**
*   **Audio:** "Who is in your foxhole? Most people surround themselves with 'Yes Men' who tell them what they want to hear. Goggins says you need people who will tell you the brutal truth. People who will call you out when you're being lazy. If your friends are always making excuses for you, they are helping you fail. Get better friends."

**Script 5: Never Finished**
*   **Audio:** "There is no finish line. You think you'll be happy when you get the job, or the house, or the money. But then what? David Goggins says: 'I am a work in progress until the day I die.' The goal isn't to arrive; the goal is to keep evolving. Stop looking for the end and start enjoying the grind. You are never finished."
