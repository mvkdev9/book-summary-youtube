**Title:** How to Master the Money Game (Tony Robbins Summary)

**[0:00-2:00] The Gatekeeper**
*   **Host:** "Wall Street is a giant casino. But the house always wins. Tony Robbins spent 4 years interviewing the best investors in history to find out how *you* can win. This is the 600-page manual: *Money: Master the Game*."

**[2:00-5:00] Step 1: The Money Machine**
*   **Host:** "You have to stop being a consumer and start being an owner. The first step is to decide on a 'Savings Percentage.' 10%, 15%, 20%—it doesn't matter. You automate it so you never see it. This is the seed money for your money machine. If you don't automate, you'll spend it. Pay yourself first."

**[5:00-7:30] Asset Allocation: The All-Weather Portfolio**
*   **Host:** "Ray Dalio told Tony his secret for a portfolio that makes money when the market goes up AND when it goes down. It’s called the **All-Weather Portfolio**. 30% Stocks, 40% Long-term Bonds, 15% Intermediate Bonds, 7.5% Gold, and 7.5% Commodities. This mix has survived every crash in the last 70 years with very little loss. It’s the ultimate safety net."

**[7:30-9:00] The Fee Trap**
*   **Host:** "Tony exposes the 'Hidden Fees' in your 401k and mutual funds. If you pay 2% in fees vs 0.1% in an index fund, you will lose **two-thirds** of your final nest egg to the bank. Stop paying for 'active' managers who can't beat the market. Buy the index and keep your money."

**[9:00-10:00] Conclusion**
*   **Host:** "Money is a tool for freedom. Master it so you can focus on what matters. Thanks for watching."

## 3. Short Form Video Scripts (30-60 Seconds)

**Script 1: Become an Owner**
*   **Audio:** "You are working for the wrong person. When you buy an iPhone, you make Apple rich. When you pay your mortgage, you make the bank rich. Tony Robbins says you have to switch from being a consumer to being an owner. Use a percentage of every paycheck to buy shares of the world's best companies. Stop spending your way to poverty and start investing your way to freedom."

**Script 2: The 2% Fee Trap**
*   **Audio:** "Is your 401k safe? Check the fees. A 2% fee doesn't sound like much, but over 30 years, it will eat 60% of your total wealth. You are doing 100% of the work and taking 100% of the risk, but the bank is taking 60% of the profit. Switch to low-cost index funds today. Don't let Wall Street steal your retirement."

**Script 3: All-Weather Portfolio**
*   **Audio:** "Are you scared of a stock market crash? You need the All-Weather Portfolio. Designed by billionaire Ray Dalio, this mix of stocks, bonds, and gold is designed to protect you in any economy. It doesn't grow as fast as 100% stocks, but it also doesn't crash when the world ends. If you want to sleep at night, diversify like a titan."

**Script 4: Your "Number"**
*   **Audio:** "Most people think they need \$10 million to be free. They don't. Tony Robbins says you should calculate 3 numbers: Financial Security, Financial Independence, and Financial Freedom. When you actually do the math on your rent, food, and utilities, you'll realize your goal is much closer than you thought. Define the target to hit it."

**Script 5: The Gift of Giving**
*   **Audio:** "Wealth isn't about what you have; it’s about what you give. Tony Robbins grew up poor, and a stranger gave his family a Thanksgiving dinner. That one act changed his life. He argues that the secret to living is giving. If you won't give a dollar out of ten, you won't give a million out of ten million. Start your 'contribution' habit today."
