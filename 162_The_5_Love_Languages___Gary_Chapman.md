**Title:** The Secret to Love That Lasts: *The 5 Love Languages*

**Introduction**
Gary Chapman, a marriage counselor, realized that people give and receive love in different ways. He calls these "Love Languages." If you are speaking "Spanish" and your partner is speaking "English," you will both feel unloved, even if you are both trying.

**The Five Love Languages**
1.  **Words of Affirmation:** Compliments, encouragement, and verbal appreciation.
2.  **Acts of Service:** Doing things your partner would like you to do. (e.g., cooking, cleaning, car maintenance). "Actions speak louder than words."
3.  **Receiving Gifts:** Tangible symbols of thought and love. It’s not about the price; it’s about the fact that you thought of them.
4.  **Quality Time:** Giving someone your undivided attention. No phones, no TV. Just together.
5.  **Physical Touch:** Hugs, kisses, holding hands, and sex. For some, this is the only language that matters.

**Key Insights**
*   **The Love Tank:** We all have an emotional love tank. If your primary language is ignored, your tank goes dry.
*   **Your Primary Language:** Most people have one or two dominant languages. Usually, we give love in the way we want to receive it.
*   **Falling in Love vs. Staying in Love:** The "in-love" phase is temporary (about 2 years). Real love is a choice to speak your partner’s language every day.

**Conclusion**
Love is a choice. By learning your partner’s language, you can keep the love tank full forever.

**Title:** Why You Feel Unloved (The 5 Love Languages Summary)

**[0:00-2:00] The Language Barrier**
*   **Host:** "Do you ever feel like you're doing everything for your partner, but they still complain that you don't love them? You're exhausted, they're frustrated. Gary Chapman says it’s because you are speaking the wrong language. Today we look at the most famous relationship book of all time: *The 5 Love Languages*."

**[2:00-5:00] The 5 Languages Defined**
*   **Host:** "Language 1 is **Words of Affirmation**. For these people, 'I love you' and 'I'm proud of you' are everything. Language 2 is **Acts of Service**. They want you to help with the dishes. Language 3 is **Receiving Gifts**. It’s the visual symbol of love. Language 4 is **Quality Time**. Put the phone down and look at them. Language 5 is **Physical Touch**. A hug is worth a thousand words."

**[5:00-7:30] The Love Tank**
*   **Host:** "Everyone has a 'Love Tank.' If your primary language is Physical Touch, and your partner gives you 100 gifts but never touches you, your tank will stay empty. You'll feel lonely and bitter. To be a great partner, you have to stop giving love the way YOU want it, and start giving it the way THEY need it."

**[7:30-9:00] Finding Your Language**
*   **Host:** "How do you find yours? Look at what you complain about most. If you say 'You never help me around the house,' your language is Acts of Service. If you say 'You're always on your phone,' it’s Quality Time. And ask your partner the same. It will save your marriage."

**[9:00-10:00] Conclusion**
*   **Host:** "Real love is a choice to learn a new language. Start today."

**Script 1: The Language Barrier**
*   **Audio:** "You think you're showing love, but your partner can't hear you. Why? Because you're speaking different languages. If you buy gifts for someone who needs Quality Time, they will feel empty. If you give compliments to someone who needs Acts of Service, they will feel unheard. Stop guessing. Ask your partner: 'What makes you feel most loved?' Learn their language."

**Script 2: Words of Affirmation**
*   **Audio:** "For some people, words are everything. One insult can destroy them for a week. One compliment can fuel them for a month. If your partner’s language is Words of Affirmation, your silence is a weapon. Tell them they look great. Tell them you appreciate their hard work. Use your voice to build them up."

**Script 3: Acts of Service**
*   **Audio:** "Is your partner always complaining about the chores? Their love language might be Acts of Service. To them, cleaning the kitchen isn't a chore—it’s a love letter. It says: 'I see your burden and I want to lighten it.' If you want to win their heart, stop talking and start doing. Pick up the vacuum and watch their love tank fill up."

**Script 4: Quality Time**
*   **Audio:** "Quality time is NOT sitting on the couch together while you both scroll TikTok. That’s just being in the same room. True Quality Time is undivided attention. Eye contact. Conversation. Doing an activity together. In a world of digital distraction, 20 minutes of real presence is the most expensive gift you can give."

**Script 5: Love is a Choice**
*   **Audio:** "The 'In-Love' feeling lasts about two years. After that, the chemicals fade. That’s when the work starts. Real love isn't a feeling; it’s a choice. It’s the choice to speak your partner’s love language even when you’re tired. It’s the choice to put their needs before your own. Don't fall in love—climb into it."
