**[2:00-5:00] Three Ways to Be Likable**
*   **Host:** "Carnegie gives us 6 rules to be likable, but let's focus on the big ones. First: **Be interested, not interesting.** Stop talking about yourself. Ask questions. Second: **The Name.** A person's name is the most important word in their life. Use it. Third: **Smile.** It’s a silent signal that says 'I like you and I'm happy to see you.'"

**[5:00-7:30] How to Win an Argument**
*   **Host:** "Here is the secret: You can't win an argument. If you lose it, you lose. If you win it, you make the other person feel inferior and resentful. You lose either way. Carnegie says the only way to get the best of an argument is to avoid it. Seek common ground instead."

**[7:30-9:00] Sincere Appreciation**
*   **Host:** "There is a difference between flattery and appreciation. Flattery is fake. Appreciation is sincere. Find one thing you truly admire about someone and tell them. It will stay with them for years. It’s the highest form of influence."

**Script 1: Be Interested**
*   **Audio:** "Want to be the most interesting person in the room? Stop talking. Dale Carnegie says: 'You can make more friends in two months by becoming genuinely interested in other people than you can in two years by trying to get other people interested in you.' Ask questions about their life, their goals, and their struggles. People will think you're a great conversationalist without you saying a word."

**Script 2: The Power of a Name**
*   **Audio:** "What is the sweetest sound in the world? It’s your own name. We are biologically wired to perk up when we hear it. Next time you meet someone, repeat their name in the conversation. 'It's great to meet you, Sarah.' 'What do you think, Sarah?' It shows you value them. It’s the easiest way to build an instant connection."

**Script 3: Don't Argue**
*   **Audio:** "You can't win an argument. Even if you prove the other person wrong, you've wounded their pride. They’ll just hate you for it. Dale Carnegie’s rule? Avoid the argument entirely. If you disagree, say: 'I might be wrong. I often am. Let’s look at the facts.' This disarms them and keeps the conversation friendly. Be smart, not 'right.'"

**Script 4: Sincere Appreciation**
*   **Audio:** "Everyone you meet is fighting a battle you know nothing about. And everyone you meet wants to feel important. Don't be stingy with your praise. If someone does a good job, tell them. If you like their shoes, say it. Sincere appreciation is the fuel of human relationships. A few kind words can change someone’s entire week."

**Script 5: Talk Interests**
*   **Audio:** "The royal road to a man's heart is to talk to him about the things he treasures most. If you're meeting a client or a date, find out what they love. Do they like golf? Travel? Cooking? Talk about *that*. When you focus on their interests, they feel understood and valued. Stop selling yourself and start exploring them."
