# Getting Past No by William Ury

## 1. Long Detailed Summary for Blog

**Title:** Negotiating in Difficult Situations: *Getting Past No*

**Introduction**
In his follow-up to *Getting to Yes*, William Ury focuses on what to do when the other person is difficult, stubborn, or aggressive. How do you get to "Yes" when they are shouting "No"?

**The 5-Step Strategy**
1.  **Don't React: Go to the Balcony:** When attacked, your instinct is to strike back or give in. Instead, mentally step onto a "balcony." Look at the situation objectively. Keep your eyes on the prize.
2.  **Don't Argue: Step to Their Side:** Disarm them by listening, acknowledging, and agreeing whenever possible. Empathy is your best weapon.
3.  **Don't Reject: Reframe:** Instead of rejecting their position, reframe it as an attempt to solve the problem. Ask questions like "Why?" and "What if?"
4.  **Don't Push: Build a Golden Bridge:** Make it easy for them to say yes. Help them save face. Make it look like their idea.
5.  **Don't Escalate: Use Power to Educate:** If they still refuse, don't threaten them. Use your power (like your BATNA) to show them that saying "Yes" is in their best interest.

**Conclusion**
The greatest obstacle to a successful negotiation is our own reaction. If we can control ourselves, we can control the room.

**Title:** How to Handle a Difficult Negotiator (Getting Past No Summary)

**[0:00-2:00] The Wall**
*   **Host:** "What do you do when the other person is a bully? They yell, they threaten, they say 'take it or leave it.' William Ury calls this 'The Wall.' You can’t break it with force. You have to go around it. Today we learn how to get *Past No*."

**[2:00-5:00] Go to the Balcony**
*   **Host:** "This is the most important skill in life. When someone insults you, don't hit back. Imagine you are standing on a balcony looking down at the argument. Ask: 'What is my goal here?' If your goal is a deal, then getting angry is a waste of energy. Stay calm. Stay detached. Don't react."

**[5:00-7:30] Step to Their Side**
*   **Host:** "It sounds crazy, but you need to agree with your enemy. If they say 'This price is ridiculous!', say 'I can see why you'd think that.' Listening is not the same as agreeing. You are just acknowledging their reality. The moment they feel heard, their anger vanishes. You’ve disarmed the bomb."

**[7:30-9:00] The Golden Bridge**
*   **Host:** "Why do people say No? Because they are afraid of looking weak. You have to build them a 'Golden Bridge.' Help them save face. Let them take the credit. If you make it easy for them to retreat with dignity, they will walk across that bridge to your side."

**[9:00-10:00] Conclusion**
*   **Host:** "Negotiation isn't about winning a fight. It’s about getting what you want. Don't escalate. Educate."

**Script 1: Go to the Balcony**
*   **Audio:** "Are you getting triggered? Stop! William Ury says you need to 'Go to the Balcony.' Imagine you are a spectator watching your own argument from above. When you distance yourself from your emotions, you can see the truth. You stop reacting and start strategizing. Don't be a puppet to your impulses. Be the director of the scene."

**Script 2: Disarm the Bully**
*   **Audio:** "How do you handle a negotiator who yells? You listen. The bully wants you to fight back so they can justify their anger. If you stay calm and say 'I hear what you're saying, tell me more,' you take away their ammunition. Silence and empathy are the ultimate weapons against aggression. Kill them with kindness, and then get to work."

**Script 3: The Golden Bridge**
*   **Audio:** "People will often refuse a good deal simply because they are embarrassed to say yes. They don't want to look like they gave in. Your job is to build a 'Golden Bridge.' Help them save face. Frame the deal as a victory for them. When you make it easy for them to say yes with their head held high, the 'No' disappears."

**Script 4: Reframe the Problem**
*   **Audio:** "Stop saying 'No.' Start asking 'How?' If someone gives you a demand, don't reject it. Reframe it. Ask: 'How would that work with our budget?' 'What if we did it this way instead?' When you turn a 'demand' into a 'question,' you move from a battle of wills to a joint problem-solving session. Change the frame, change the outcome."

**Script 5: Use Power to Educate**
*   **Audio:** "What is the difference between a threat and a warning? A threat says 'If you don't do this, I will hurt you.' A warning says 'If we don't agree, this is what will happen to both of us.' Use your power to educate, not to intimidate. Show them the reality of 'No' until 'Yes' is the only logical choice. Be a teacher, not a tyrant."
