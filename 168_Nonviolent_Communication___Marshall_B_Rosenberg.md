# Nonviolent Communication by Marshall B. Rosenberg

## 1. Long Detailed Summary for Blog

**Title:** A Language of Life: *Nonviolent Communication*

**Introduction**
Marshall Rosenberg argues that most of our language is "life-alienating." We judge, label, and demand. "Nonviolent Communication" (NVC) is a 4-step process to connect with our own needs and the needs of others using empathy and honesty.

**The 4 Components of NVC**
1.  **Observations:** Stating the concrete facts without judgment or evaluation. (e.g., "I see three dirty dishes" instead of "You are lazy").
2.  **Feelings:** Stating how you feel in relation to what you observe. (e.g., "I feel frustrated").
3.  **Needs:** Identifying the universal human needs that are creating the feelings. (e.g., "Because I need order in the house").
4.  **Requests:** Asking for a specific action to fulfill the need. It must be a request, not a demand. (e.g., "Would you be willing to wash them?").

**Key Insights**
*   **The Jackal vs. The Giraffe:** Jackal language is judgmental and aggressive. Giraffe language is empathetic and heart-centered.
*   **Empathy:** Being present to another person’s feelings and needs without trying to fix or judge them.

**Conclusion**
NVC transforms conflict into connection. It is the language of the heart.

**Title:** How to Say Anything to Anyone (NVC Summary)

**[0:00-2:00] The Violent Language**
*   **Host:** "We think 'violence' is physical. But Marshall Rosenberg says our language is violent too. When we say 'You’re selfish' or 'You’re wrong,' we are attacking. And when we attack, people defend. Today we learn the language of peace: *Nonviolent Communication*."

**[2:00-5:00] Step 1 & 2: Observations and Feelings**
*   **Host:** "Step 1: **Observation**. You have to be a video camera. Don't say 'You're always late.' That’s a judgment. Say 'You arrived at 8:15 for the 8:00 meeting.' Step 2: **Feelings**. Share your emotion. 'I feel anxious.' Not 'I feel like you don't care.' That’s a thought, not a feeling."

**[5:00-7:30] Step 3 & 4: Needs and Requests**
*   **Host:** "Step 3: **Needs**. Every feeling is caused by a need. 'I feel anxious because I have a need for reliability.' Step 4: **Requests**. Be specific. Don't say 'Be better.' Say 'Would you be willing to call me if you're running late?' A request is only a request if the other person can say 'No' without being punished."

**[7:30-9:00] Empathy**
*   **Host:** "NVC isn't just about talking; it's about listening. When someone yells at you, they are expressing an unmet need. If you can hear the 'Need' behind the 'Yell,' you can stop the fight before it starts. Don't take it personally; take it empathically."

**[9:00-10:00] Conclusion**
*   **Host:** "Change your words, change your world. Try the 4 steps today."

## 3. Short Form Video Scripts (30-60 Seconds)

**Script 1: Observations over Judgments**
*   **Audio:** "Stop using words like 'always' and 'never.' They are judgments, not facts. When you judge someone, they stop listening. Use the Video Camera Test. If a camera wouldn't see it, it’s not an observation. Instead of 'You’re messy,' say 'There are clothes on the floor.' Facts disarm; judgments provoke. Stick to the facts."

**Script 2: Feelings are not Thoughts**
*   **Audio:** "Most people don't know how to express feelings. They say 'I feel like you’re being mean.' That isn't a feeling; that is an evaluation of someone else. A real feeling is one word: 'I feel sad,' 'I feel lonely,' 'I feel frustrated.' When you share a real feeling, you invite connection. When you share a thought, you invite an argument."

**Script 3: Needs are Universal**
*   **Audio:** "Every human being on Earth has the same needs: Respect, Safety, Autonomy, Support. Conflict only happens because we disagree on HOW to meet those needs. If you can identify the need behind the conflict, the solution becomes easy. Stop fighting about the strategy and start talking about the need."

**Script 4: Request or Demand?**
*   **Audio:** "Are you making a request or a demand? Here is the test: If the person says 'No,' and you get angry or try to make them feel guilty, it was a demand. Demands create resentment. Requests create cooperation. If you want a healthy relationship, you have to give people the freedom to say No."

**Script 5: Listen for the Need**
*   **Audio:** "When someone is angry at you, they are speaking a tragic language. They are desperately trying to get a need met, but they don't know how to ask. Instead of defending yourself, try to hear the need. Ask: 'Are you feeling frustrated because you need more support?' When people feel heard, their anger vanishes. Empathy is the ultimate de-escalator."
