# Cues by Vanessa Van Edwards

## 1. Long Detailed Summary for Blog

**Title:** Master the Secret Language of Charismatic Communication: *Cues*

**Introduction**
In her follow-up to *Captivate*, Vanessa Van Edwards focuses on the specific "Cues" we send—both verbally and non-verbally. She argues that charisma is a balance of two things: **Warmth** and **Competence**.

**The Charisma Matrix**
1.  **Warmth:** Do I like you? (Approachable, kind, trustworthy).
2.  **Competence:** Can I rely on you? (Smart, capable, powerful).
*   High Warmth + High Competence = **Charismatic**.
*   High Warmth + Low Competence = **Pity/Friend-zone**.
*   Low Warmth + High Competence = **Resentment/Fear**.
*   Low Warmth + Low Competence = **Invisible**.

**Key Cues**
*   **The Steeple:** Putting your fingertips together. (Signals high competence).
*   **The Head Tilt:** Tilting your head to the side. (Signals high warmth).
*   **Vocal Cues:** Avoid the "Question Inflection" (going up at the end of a sentence). It makes you sound incompetent.
*   **The Eyebrow Raise:** A signal of curiosity and interest.

**Conclusion**
You are constantly sending cues. By learning to control them, you can change how the world perceives you.

**Title:** The 2 Secrets to Being Charismatic (Warmth and Competence)

**[0:00-2:00] The Charisma Equation**
*   **Host:** "Why do we love some people and fear others? Vanessa Van Edwards says it’s a simple math equation. Charisma = Warmth + Competence. If you are all Warmth, you're a pushover. If you are all Competence, you're a robot. You need both to be a leader. Today we master *Cues*."

**[2:00-5:00] Non-Verbal Competence**
*   **Host:** "How do you look smart without saying a word? Use 'Competence Cues.' The best one is **The Steeple**. Join your fingertips in a triangle. It shows confidence and control. Also, keep your chin level. If you tilt your chin up, you look arrogant. If you tilt it down, you look weak. Level is powerful."

**[5:00-7:30] Non-Verbal Warmth**
*   **Host:** "Now, how do you look friendly? Use 'Warmth Cues.' The **Head Tilt** is the king of warmth. It exposes your neck—a vulnerable spot—and tells the other person 'I am listening.' Combine this with a slow, genuine smile, and people will instantly feel comfortable around you."

**[7:30-9:00] Vocal Cues**
*   **Host:** "Stop using the 'Question Inflection.' That’s when your voice goes up at the end of a sentence? Like you're asking for permission? It kills your authority. Use the 'Statement Inflection.' Speak with a downward tone. It signals that you know exactly what you're talking about."

**[9:00-10:00] Conclusion**
*   **Host:** "Audit your cues. Are you missing warmth or competence? Fix the balance."

**Script 1: Warmth vs Competence**
*   **Audio:** "You are being judged on two things: Warmth and Competence. Warmth says 'I like you.' Competence says 'I can help you.' If you're a manager, you need both. If you only have warmth, your team won't respect you. If you only have competence, they’ll be afraid of you. To be charismatic, you have to tilt your head to show you're listening, and steeple your hands to show you're the boss."

**Script 2: The Question Inflection**
*   **Audio:** "You are sabotaging your own career with your voice. It’s called 'Upspeak.' It’s when your voice goes up at the end of a sentence? Like everything is a question? It makes you sound like you aren't sure of yourself. If you want to sound competent, use the 'Statement Inflection.' End your sentences with a lower tone. Speak like you mean it, and people will believe you."

**Script 3: The Steeple**
*   **Audio:** "What do Angela Merkel and Oprah Winfrey have in common? They both use 'The Steeple.' It’s when you touch your fingertips together to form a triangle. It’s the universal cue for 'I am an expert and I am confident.' Next time you're in a meeting and you want to look powerful, put your hands in a steeple. It’s a silent signal of authority."

**Script 4: The Head Tilt**
*   **Audio:** "Want someone to like you instantly? Tilt your head. Vanessa Van Edwards found that tilting your head to the side signals high warmth and empathy. It shows you are engaged and non-threatening. It’s the easiest way to break the ice in a first meeting. Tilt your head, show your neck, and watch the walls come down."

**Script 5: Digital Cues**
*   **Audio:** "Cues aren't just for in-person. You send them in your emails too! Using all caps signals aggression. Using zero exclamation points can signal coldness. Using too many can signal low competence. To be a charismatic writer, use 'Warm' greetings and 'Competent' bullet points. Your text is your body language in the digital world."
