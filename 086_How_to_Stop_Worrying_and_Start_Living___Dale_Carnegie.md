*   **Audio:** "You are trying to carry too much. You're carrying the regrets of 10 years ago and the fears of 10 years from now. It’s too heavy! Use Dale Carnegie's 'Day-Tight Compartments.' Seal off the past. Seal off the future. Just live in the next 24 hours. Handle today’s problems today. You have the strength for one day, but not for 20 years at once."

**Script 2: The Worst Case**
*   **Audio:** "Anxiety is the fear of the unknown. Shine a light on it. Ask: 'What is the worst that could happen?' Get specific. Once you define the worst-case scenario, accept it. Tell yourself: 'I can survive that.' The moment you accept the worst, you lose the fear. And when you lose the fear, you can finally start fixing the problem."

**Script 3: Busy is the Cure**
*   **Audio:** "It is mentally impossible for the human brain to think of more than one thing at a time. This is why 'Action' is the best cure for worry. When you are busy working, planning, or helping others, your brain literally doesn't have the bandwidth to worry. If you are stressed, get moving. Put your hands to work and your mind will follow."

**Script 4: Stop-Loss Order**
*   **Audio:** "Traders use a 'Stop-Loss Order' to limit their losses. You should do the same with your emotions. If a friend is late, give yourself 10 minutes of annoyance. After that, put a stop-loss on it. Refuse to give them any more of your peace of mind. Decide how much worry an event is worth, and never pay a penny more."

**Script 5: The Law of Averages**
*   **Audio:** "90% of the things you worry about will never happen. That’s not an opinion; it’s the Law of Averages. We stress over plane crashes, rare diseases, and freak accidents. Ask yourself: 'What is the statistical probability of this happening?' Most of the time, the answer is zero. Stop living in a horror movie that isn't real."
