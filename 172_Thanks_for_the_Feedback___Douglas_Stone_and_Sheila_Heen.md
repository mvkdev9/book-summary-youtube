# Thanks for the Feedback by Douglas Stone and Sheila Heen

## 1. Long Detailed Summary for Blog

**Title:** The Science and Art of Receiving Feedback Well: *Thanks for the Feedback*

**Introduction**
We spend all our time learning how to *give* feedback, but the authors argue that the *receiver* is in charge. It’s up to you to decide what to let in and what to discard. Receiving feedback well is a skill that can be developed.

**The Three Types of Feedback**
1.  **Appreciation:** To thank, connect, or motivate.
2.  **Coaching:** To help someone expand their skills or improve.
3.  **Evaluation:** To rank or rate someone against a set of standards.
*   *Key:* We often get "wrong-spotted"—we want appreciation but get coaching, or we want coaching but get evaluation.

**The Three Triggers (That block feedback)**
1.  **Truth Triggers:** The feedback is wrong, unfair, or unhelpful. (The "That's not true!" reaction).
2.  **Relationship Triggers:** I can't hear this from *you*. (Focusing on the person, not the message).
3.  **Identity Triggers:** The feedback threatens my sense of self. (The spiral of shame).

**Key Insights**
*   **The Second Score:** Your first score is the feedback itself. Your second score is how you *handle* the feedback. You can always get an A+ on the second score.
*   **Switchtrack Conversations:** When two people talk about two different things (e.g., He talks about the messy kitchen, she talks about his tone). Stop and address both tracks separately.

**Conclusion**
Feedback is the only way we grow. Learn to find the "nugget of truth" in even the worst delivery.

**Title:** How to Take Criticism Like a Boss

**[0:00-2:00] The Receiver is King**
*   **Host:** "Most books teach you how to give feedback. But Douglas Stone says that is backward. The receiver is the one who decides if the information is used. You are the gatekeeper of your own growth. Today we learn *Thanks for the Feedback*."

**[2:00-5:00] The Three Triggers**
*   **Host:** "Why is it so hard to hear 'Can I give you some advice?' because your brain has 3 triggers. **Truth Triggers**: 'You're wrong!' **Relationship Triggers**: 'Who are you to tell me that?' And **Identity Triggers**: 'I'm a failure!' To listen, you have to recognize which trigger is firing and calm it down."

**[5:00-7:30] Appreciation, Coaching, Evaluation**
*   **Host:** "We often get 'wrong-spotted.' You show your partner a project you're proud of—you want **Appreciation**. They give you **Coaching** ('You should fix this part'). You get mad. They get confused. Next time, ask for what you need! 'I just need a high-five right now, not a critique.'"

**[7:30-9:00] The Second Score**
*   **Host:** "If you get a bad review at work, don't panic. You have two scores. Score 1 is the review. Score 2 is how you react. If you take it with grace and curiosity, you win Score 2. And Score 2 is what your boss will actually remember."

**[9:00-10:00] Conclusion**
*   **Host:** "Feedback is a gift, even when the wrapping paper is ugly. Find the truth."

**Script 1: The Second Score**
*   **Audio:** "You just got some brutal feedback. You feel like a failure. Stop. Remember the 'Second Score.' Score 1 is the criticism you just received. You can't change that. Score 2 is how you handle it. Do you get defensive? Or do you ask questions? If you handle it with maturity and curiosity, you get an A+ on the second score. And the second score is what determines your reputation."

**Script 2: Switchtrack Conversations**
*   **Audio:** "Are you arguing about two different things? Your partner says 'You're late' (the content). You say 'Why are you yelling at me?' (the relationship). Now you're on two different tracks. He wants to talk about time; you want to talk about respect. Stop the 'Switchtrack.' Say: 'I hear you're upset about the time. I also want to talk about your tone. Let's do both, one at a time.'"

**Script 3: Truth vs. Identity**
*   **Audio:** "Feedback often triggers an identity crisis. You hear 'This report was messy' and your brain translates it to 'I am incompetent.' This is an Identity Trigger. To fix it, you have to realize that you are more than any single task. You are a person who is learning. Detach your self-worth from your work, and you'll be able to listen without spiraling."

**Script 4: Ask for What You Need**
*   **Audio:** "Before you show someone your work, tell them what kind of feedback you want. Do you want **Appreciation** (just a 'good job')? Do you want **Coaching** (how to get better)? Or do you want **Evaluation** (is this a pass or fail)? Most conflicts happen because one person wants a hug and the other gives a lecture. Set the expectation first."

**Script 5: The Nugget of Truth**
*   **Audio:** "90% of the feedback you get might be wrong. It might be delivered badly, by someone you don't like, at the wrong time. But your job is to find the 10% that is useful. Don't throw the whole thing away just because the delivery was terrible. Be a gold miner. Sift through the dirt to find the one nugget that will make you better."
