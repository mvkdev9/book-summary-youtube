# First Things First by Stephen R. Covey

## 1. Long Detailed Summary for Blog

**Title:** Putting Priorities Before The Clock: *First Things First*

**Introduction**
Stephen Covey follows up on the 7 Habits with a deep dive into Habit 3: Put First Things First. He contrasts "The Clock" (speed, efficiency) with "The Compass" (direction, values).

**The Time Management Matrix (Eisenhower Matrix)**
1.  **Quadrant I: Urgent & Important.** (Crises, Deadlines). "The Quadrant of Necessity." Living here leads to burnout.
2.  **Quadrant II: Not Urgent & Important.** (Planning, Relationship Building, Prevention). "The Quadrant of Quality." This is where you should live.
3.  **Quadrant III: Urgent & Not Important.** (Interruptions, Some emails). "The Quadrant of Deception." We think it's important, but it's just urgent.
4.  **Quadrant IV: Not Urgent & Not Important.** (Trivia, Time wasters). "The Quadrant of Waste."

**The Strategy**
*   **Live in Q2:** You must say "No" to Q3 and Q4 to make time for Q2.
*   **Weekly Planning:** Daily planning is too narrow (crisis management). Weekly planning allows for balance and Q2 activities.

**Key Concepts**
*   **Integrity in the Moment of Choice:** It’s easy to prioritize when calm. The test is when the phone rings.
*   **Roles and Goals:** define your roles (Father, Manager, Friend) and set goals for each.

**Conclusion**
Don't prioritize your schedule; schedule your priorities.

## 2. Long Form YouTube Video Script (10 Minutes)

**Title:** The Clock vs. The Compass (First Things First)

**[0:00-2:00] The Jar of Rocks**
*   **Host:** "You know the story. A professor fills a jar with big rocks. 'Is it full?' Yes. Then he adds pebbles. Then sand. Then water."
*   **Host:** "The lesson? If you don't put the Big Rocks in first, they will never fit. The sand (trivial tasks) will fill the jar. *First Things First* is about identifying your Big Rocks."

**[2:00-5:00] The 4 Quadrants**
*   **Host:** "Covey introduces the Time Management Matrix."
*   **QI (Urgent/Important):** "The house is on fire. You have to handle this."
*   **QIII (Urgent/Not Important):** "The phone ringing. A text. It feels important, but it's not. This is where we get tricked."
*   **QIV (Not Urgent/Not Important):** "Doomscrolling. Escape."
*   **QII (Not Urgent/Important):** "This is the Magic Zone. Exercise. Planning. Dating your spouse. It’s never 'Urgent,' so we skip it. But it prevents the fires in QI."

**[5:00-7:00] Weekly Planning**
*   **Host:** "Stop planning daily. It’s too zoomed in. Plan weekly. On Sunday, look at the week. Ask: 'What are the Big Rocks for my roles?'"
*   **Host:** "Role: Parent. Goal: Take kid to park. Schedule it first. Then let the sand fill around it."

**[7:00-9:00] Integrity**
*   **Host:** "The hardest part is saying NO to the Urgent to do the Important. It takes integrity."

**[9:00-10:00] Conclusion**
*   **Host:** "Throw away the clock. Follow the compass."

## 3. Short Form Video Scripts (30-60 Seconds)

**Script 1: The Matrix**
*   **Audio:** "Draw a square. Divide it into four. This is the Eisenhower Matrix. Q1: Urgent/Important (Crisis). Q2: Not Urgent/Important (Growth). Q3: Urgent/Not Important (Distraction). Q4: Neither (Waste). Successful people don't live in Q1; they live in Q2. They prevent the crisis before it happens. Move to Q2."

**Script 2: Big Rocks**
*   **Audio:** "If you fill your day with sand (emails, texts), you won't have room for the rocks (dreams, family). You must put the Big Rocks in first. Schedule your most important tasks before the day begins. Then let the trivial stuff fit into the cracks. You can't fit a Big Rock into a jar full of sand."

**Script 3: Clock vs. Compass**
*   **Audio:** "We are obsessed with the Clock—how fast we are going. But we ignore the Compass—where we are going. It doesn't matter how fast you climb the ladder if it's leaning against the wrong wall. Slow down. Check your compass. Are you moving toward your True North, or just moving fast?"

**Script 4: The Quadrant of Deception**
*   **Audio:** "Quadrant 3 is the 'Quadrant of Deception.' It’s things that are Urgent but Not Important. The ringing phone. The interruption. The 'urgent' email. We feel productive doing them, but we are just being busy. Learn to recognize Q3 and say 'No.' Protect your time for what matters."

**Script 5: Weekly Planning**
*   **Audio:** "Daily planning is reactive. You wake up and put out fires. Weekly planning is proactive. You look at the big picture. You schedule your exercise, your reading, and your family time *before* the week attacks you. Take 30 minutes every Sunday to design your week. It changes everything."
