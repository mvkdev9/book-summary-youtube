**Title:** How to Change Your "Money Blueprint" (Eker Summary)

**[0:00-2:00] The Thermostat**
*   **Host:** "Why do lottery winners lose all their money? Because their internal 'Money Thermostat' is set to zero. Even if they get millions, their brain will find a way to spend it all until it hits the 'comfortable' number. T. Harv Eker says you have a **Money Blueprint**. And today we learn how to re-program it."

**[2:00-5:00] I Create My Life**
*   **Host:** "Wealth File #1: Rich people believe they are the captain of their ship. Poor people feel like victims. If you are constantly complaining about the economy or your boss, you are in 'Victim Mode.' And a victim can never be rich. You have to take 100% responsibility for your bank account. Stop the blame game and start the building game."

**[5:00-7:30] Focus on Net Worth**
*   **Host:** "Poor people only care about their 'Salary.' But rich people focus on **Net Worth**. Net worth is everything: your savings, your home, your stocks, minus your debt. A doctor who makes \$300k but spends \$300k is broke. A teacher who makes \$50k but has \$500k in stocks is rich. Measure what matters."

**[7:30-9:00] Admire the Rich**
*   **Host:** "Do you secretly hate rich people? Do you think they are 'greedy' or 'evil'? Eker says that is the fastest way to stay poor. You cannot become something you resent! If you want to be rich, you have to admire and study the wealthy. Bless that which you want. Celebrate their success so you can attract your own."

**[9:00-10:00] Conclusion**
*   **Host:** "Change your blueprint. Think big. Be rich."

**Script 1: Your Money Blueprint**
*   **Audio:** "Your bank account is a physical result of your internal thoughts. T. Harv Eker calls this your 'Money Blueprint.' If you grew up hearing that 'money is the root of all evil,' you have a blueprint for being broke. You will subconsciously sabotage yourself to stay poor. To get rich, you have to find those old files in your brain and replace them with new ones. Change your mind, change your money."

**Script 2: Victim or Victor?**
*   **Audio:** "Stop complaining. Every time you complain, you are putting yourself in 'Victim Mode.' And have you ever noticed that rich people don't complain much? It’s because they believe: 'I create my life.' If things are bad, they fix them. If you want to be wealthy, you have to give up your right to be a victim. Take 100% ownership of your results and watch your power grow."

**Script 3: Net Worth vs Salary**
*   **Audio:** "How much is your salary? It doesn't matter. The only number that matters is your Net Worth. Net worth is the total value of everything you own minus what you owe. You can make a million dollars a year and still be broke if your net worth is zero. Stop chasing the high-paying job and start chasing the high-value assets. Build wealth, not just income."

**Script 4: Admire the Wealthy**
*   **Audio:** "If you resent rich people, you'll never be one. Why would your brain let you become something you hate? Next time you see someone in a private jet or a Ferrari, don't roll your eyes. Say: 'Good for them!' Admire their success and study their habits. When you celebrate wealth, you signal to the universe that you are ready for it too. Bless what you want."

**Script 5: Think Big**
*   **Audio:** "Small thinking is a disease. If your goal is just to 'pay the bills,' you’ll never have more than enough to pay the bills. Rich people think BIG. They want to impact thousands of people. The world will pay you in proportion to the value you deliver. If you help 10 people, you'll be comfortable. If you help a million, you'll be a billionaire. Increase your scale to increase your wealth."
