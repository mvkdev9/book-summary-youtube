**Title:** Negotiating as if Your Life Depended on It: *Never Split the Difference*

**Introduction**
Chris Voss, a former lead FBI hostage negotiator, argues that traditional negotiation tactics (like "Getting to Yes") are flawed because they assume people are rational. In high-stakes situations, emotions are everything. Voss provides a set of psychological tools to gain the upper hand in any negotiation—from buying a car to asking for a raise.

**Key Techniques**
1.  **Mirroring:** Repeat the last 3 words (or the critical 1-3 words) of what the other person said. It encourages them to keep talking and bond with you.
2.  **Labeling:** Name the emotion you're seeing. "It seems like you're afraid of losing control." It validates their feelings and de-escalates the amygdala.
3.  **No is Better than Yes:** People feel safe when they say "No." Use questions that invite a No (e.g., "Is it a ridiculous idea to...?").
4.  **That's Right:** The magic words. When the other person says "That's right," they feel you truly understand them. (Avoid "You're right," which is often a brush-off).
5.  **Calibrated Questions:** Use "How" and "What" questions to force the other person to solve your problems. (e.g., "How am I supposed to do that?").
6.  **The Ackerman Model:** A 4-step process for setting a price.

**Conclusion**
Negotiation is about empathy and tactical intelligence. Never split the difference; that usually leads to a result that makes both sides unhappy.

**Title:** FBI Secrets for Negotiation (Never Split the Difference Summary)

**[0:00-2:00] The Hostage Mindset**
*   **Host:** "Chris Voss spent 24 years negotiating with terrorists and kidnappers. If he failed, people died. He learned that you can't 'Split the Difference' with a kidnapper—you can't give them 2 hostages and keep 2. You have to win. Today we learn how to win in the real world."

**[2:00-5:00] Mirroring and Labeling**
*   **Host:** "The two most powerful tools are **Mirroring** and **Labeling**. Mirroring is just repeating the last 3 words someone said as a question. It makes them feel heard and makes them give you more data. Labeling is naming their fear. 'It sounds like you're worried about the budget.' When you name a ghost, it loses its power."

**[5:00-7:30] The Power of "No"**
*   **Host:** "We are obsessed with getting a 'Yes.' But Voss says 'No' is the most powerful word. When someone says 'No,' they feel in control. Ask them: 'Is it totally crazy to think we could do X?' They say 'No,' and then they are ready to listen. Stop pushing for 'Yes' and start inviting 'No.'"

**[7:30-9:00] Calibrated Questions**
*   **Host:** "The ultimate tool for a deadlock: **The Calibrated Question**. Ask: 'How am I supposed to do that?' You aren't being rude; you are inviting them to solve your problem. It forces the other person to look at the situation from your perspective."

**[9:00-10:00] Conclusion**
*   **Host:** "Negotiation is an act of empathy. Learn the tools. Get the deal."

**Script 1: Mirroring**
*   **Audio:** "Want to get more information from anyone? Use Mirroring. It’s an FBI trick. Just repeat the last 3 words they said as a question. 
    Person: 'I’m having a hard time with this project.' 
    You: 'With this project?' 
    Person: 'Yeah, because the deadline is too short...' 
    They will keep talking and keep revealing their secrets. It’s like a magic button for conversation. Try it today."

**Script 2: Labeling Emotions**
*   **Audio:** "When someone is angry, don't ignore it. Label it. Say: 'It seems like you're feeling disrespected.' Or 'It looks like you're worried about the cost.' Chris Voss found that when you label an emotion, the emotional part of the brain shuts down and the logical part turns on. Naming the fear kills the fear. Don't judge the feeling; just label it."

**Script 3: That’s Right vs. You're Right**
*   **Audio:** "There are two dangerous words in a negotiation: 'You're Right.' When someone says that, they are usually just trying to get you to shut up. But when they say '**That's Right**,' it means they feel truly understood. The moment you get a 'That's Right,' the negotiation is over—you've won. Work until you hear those two words."

**Script 4: No is a Shield**
*   **Audio:** "Stop asking 'Is this a good time to talk?' Everyone says 'No' because they want to feel safe. Instead, ask: 'Is this a **bad** time to talk?' Now, when they say 'No,' they are agreeing to talk! We feel protected when we say No. Use that psychology to your advantage. Flip your questions to get the No."

**Script 5: How am I supposed to do that?**
*   **Audio:** "Are you being bullied in a deal? Use the magic question: 'How am I supposed to do that?' It’s the ultimate calibrated question. It stops the other person in their tracks and forces them to see your side of the problem. You aren't saying No; you are asking for their help to find a Yes. Make them solve your problems for you."
