# Procrastinate on Purpose by Rory Vaden

## 1. Long Detailed Summary for Blog

**Title:** How to Multiply Your Time: *Procrastinate on Purpose*

**Introduction**
Rory Vaden introduces a new dimension to time management: **Significance**.
*   Efficiency = How fast can I do it?
*   Effectiveness = What should I do?
*   Significance = How long will this matter?

**The Focus Funnel**
When a task comes in, put it through the funnel:
1.  **Eliminate:** Can I ignore this? (Permission to ignore).
2.  **Automate:** Can a system do this? (Invest time to save time).
3.  **Delegate:** Can someone else do this? (The 30x Rule: Spend 30x the time it takes to do a task training someone else to do it).
4.  **Procrastinate (on Purpose):** Can this wait? (Wait until it becomes urgent or disappears).
5.  **Concentrate:** If it can't be eliminated, automated, delegated, or delayed... do it.

**Key Concepts**
*   **The Multiplier Mindset:** Multipliers spend time today to create more time tomorrow. (e.g., Setting up online bill pay takes 1 hour today, but saves 30 mins every month forever).
*   **ROTI:** Return on Time Invested.

**Conclusion**
You can't manage time; you can only prioritize it. Multiply your time by giving yourself permission to spend time on things that create more time.

**Title:** How to Multiply Your Time (The Focus Funnel)

**[0:00-2:00] The 3rd Dimension of Time**
*   **Host:** "We all know Efficiency (speed) and Priority (importance). Rory Vaden says there is a third dimension: Significance. How long will this matter?"
*   **Host:** "This is the 'Multiplier Mindset.' A multiplier asks: 'What can I do today that will give me more time tomorrow?'"

**[2:00-6:00] The Focus Funnel**
*   **Host:** "Imagine a funnel. You pour all your tasks in the top."
*   **Level 1: Eliminate.** "Is this worth doing? No? Goodbye."
*   **Level 2: Automate.** "This is the classic multiplier. Spend 2 hours setting up a macro or a template. It saves you 5 minutes a day. That is 30 hours a year. You traded 2 hours for 30."
*   **Level 3: Delegate.** "Can someone else do it? Vaden has the '30x Rule.' If a task takes 5 minutes, spend 150 minutes (5x30) training someone to do it. It sounds crazy, but after that, you are free forever."

**[6:00-8:00] Procrastinate on Purpose**
*   **Host:** "If you can't delegate, can you wait? This is 'Procrastinating on Purpose.' Sometimes, if you wait, the problem solves itself. Or it becomes clearer. Don't act prematurely."

**[8:00-9:00] Concentrate**
*   **Host:** "If it passes all filters, then you Concentrate. Protect the task and get it done."

**[9:00-10:00] Conclusion**
*   **Host:** "Don't just manage time. Multiply it."

## 3. Short Form Video Scripts (30-60 Seconds)

**Script 1: The Multiplier Mindset**
*   **Audio:** "Stop managing time. Start multiplying it. How? By spending time today on things that create more time tomorrow. If you spend 1 hour setting up online bill pay, you save 30 minutes every month for the rest of your life. That is a massive Return on Investment. Don't be busy; be strategic."

**Script 2: The 30x Rule**
*   **Audio:** "You don't delegate because 'it's faster to do it myself.' Short term, yes. Long term, you are losing. Use the 30x Rule. If a task takes 5 minutes, you should be willing to spend 150 minutes (30x) training someone else to do it. Why? Because over a year, that task takes 1200 minutes. Investing 150 to save 1200 is a no-brainer."

**Script 3: Procrastinate on Purpose**
*   **Audio:** "We think procrastination is bad. But 'Procrastinating on Purpose' is a superpower. It means consciously deciding *not* to do something yet. Many problems solve themselves if you wait. Many emails don't need a reply. Wait until the last possible moment to see if it still matters. Patience saves work."

**Script 4: Automation is Wealth**
*   **Audio:** "Wealth isn't just money; it's time. And automation is the mint. Every time you automate a task—whether it's a recurring order, a template, or a software script—you are minting future time. You are buying your freedom. Look at your to-do list. What can be automated? That is your most valuable task."

**Script 5: Significance**
*   **Audio:** "Efficiency is doing things fast. Effectiveness is doing important things. Significance is doing things that last. The Multiplier focuses on Significance. 'Will this matter in a year?' If not, try to eliminate it. Focus on the legacy of your time, not just the volume of your tasks."
