# No More Mr. Nice Guy by Robert A. Glover

## 1. Long Detailed Summary for Blog

**Title:** A Proven Plan for Getting What You Want in Love, Sex, and Life: *No More Mr. Nice Guy*

**Introduction**
Dr. Robert Glover identifies a syndrome common in modern men: The "Nice Guy." A Nice Guy isn't actually "nice"; he is a man who believes that if he is "good" and does everything "right," he will be loved and have a problem-free life. When this doesn't work, he becomes resentful, passive-aggressive, and dishonest.

**The Nice Guy's "Covert Contracts"**
The hallmark of the Nice Guy is the Covert Contract:
1.  "If I am a good person, then everyone will love me."
2.  "If I help others, then they will help me (without me asking)."
3.  "If I do everything right, then my life will be easy."
*   *Key:* These contracts are never spoken, so they are always broken, leading to massive resentment.

**The Road to Recovery**
1.  **Stop Seeking Approval:** Do what is right for you, not what will make others happy.
2.  **Set Boundaries:** Learn to say "No."
3.  **Prioritize Your Needs:** It is not selfish to take care of yourself first.
4.  **Embrace Your Masculinity:** Connect with other men and find your own power.
5.  **Be Direct:** Stop hinting and start asking for what you want.

**Conclusion**
Being a "Integrated Man" is better than being a "Nice Guy." An integrated man is honest, boundaried, and takes responsibility for his own happiness.

**Title:** The Nice Guy Trap (And How to Break Free)

**[0:00-2:00] Are You a Nice Guy?**
*   **Host:** "Do you feel like you do everything for everyone, but you never get what you want? Do you avoid conflict? Do you try to please your partner at any cost? You might be a 'Nice Guy.' And Dr. Robert Glover says that is your biggest problem. Today we look at *No More Mr. Nice Guy*."

**[2:00-5:00] The Covert Contract**
*   **Host:** "Nice Guys live by 'Covert Contracts.' It’s an unspoken deal. 'I will be perfectly nice to you, and in return, you will have sex with me / give me a raise / make me happy.' But the other person didn't sign the contract! When you don't get the reward, you get angry. This is why Nice Guys are actually very manipulative. They are trading kindness for compliance."

**[5:00-7:30] The Fear of Conflict**
*   **Host:** "Nice Guys are terrified of 'The Truth.' They lie or hide things to keep the peace. But you can't have a real relationship without conflict. You have to be able to say: 'I don't like that.' You have to be able to set boundaries. A man with no boundaries is a man with no respect."

**[7:30-9:00] Becoming Integrated**
*   **Host:** "Glover suggests becoming an 'Integrated Man.' This isn't a jerk. It’s a man who is honest about his needs. He takes care of himself first so he has the energy to help others. He stops asking for permission to exist. He is the master of his own destiny."

**[9:00-10:00] Conclusion**
*   **Host:** "Stop being nice. Start being real."

**Script 1: The Nice Guy Lie**
*   **Audio:** "There is a difference between being a good man and being a 'Nice Guy.' A good man is honest and brave. A Nice Guy is a man who hides his true feelings to get approval. He’s a people-pleaser who is secretly full of resentment. If you're always trying to make everyone else happy while you suffer, you aren't being nice—you're being a martyr. Stop the lie."

**Script 2: Covert Contracts**
*   **Audio:** "Are you making 'Covert Contracts'? This is when you do something for someone and EXPECT them to do something back, but you never tell them. 'I took her to dinner, so she should be in the mood.' That’s not love; that’s manipulation. If you want something, ask for it directly. Stop the games and start the communication."

**Script 3: Boundaries are Respect**
*   **Audio:** "Why does nobody respect you? Probably because you never say 'No.' Nice Guys think that by saying 'Yes' to everything, they will be liked. But people don't like doormats; they use them. Respect comes from having boundaries. It comes from having values that you won't compromise. Stand up for yourself, and the world will stand up for you."

**Script 4: Prioritize Yourself**
*   **Audio:** "You can't pour from an empty cup. Nice Guys try to save the world while their own lives are falling apart. They think it’s 'selfish' to focus on themselves. It’s not. It’s a responsibility. Take care of your health, your money, and your mind first. When you are strong and happy, you can actually help people. Be your own priority."

**Script 5: Stop Seeking Approval**
*   **Audio:** "Whose life are you living? If you are constantly asking 'What will they think?', you are a prisoner. The Nice Guy's greatest addiction is the approval of others. Break the habit today. Do one thing because YOU want to do it, even if someone else disagrees. Reclaim your autonomy. You don't need a permission slip to be yourself."
