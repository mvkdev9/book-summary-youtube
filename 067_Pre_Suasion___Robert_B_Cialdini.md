# Pre-Suasion by Robert B. Cialdini

## 1. Long Detailed Summary for Blog

**Title:** A Revolutionary Way to Influence and Persuade: *Pre-Suasion*

**Introduction**
In his follow-up to *Influence*, Robert Cialdini argues that the most important part of a sale or negotiation happens *before* you make your request. "Pre-Suasion" is the act of arranging the audience's attention so they are receptive to the message before they even hear it.

**Key Insights**
1.  **Privileged Moments:** There is a window of time after a "Pre-Suasive" act where the target is most likely to agree.
2.  **Attention is Importance:** Whatever we are paying attention to in the moment, we assume is important.
3.  **The Background Matters:** (e.g., A furniture site with fluffy clouds in the background makes people buy soft sofas; pennies make them buy cheap ones).
4.  **The Power of Questioning:** If you ask someone "Are you adventurous?", they will search their memory for examples of when they were adventurous, making them more likely to try a new product.

**The Seventh Principle: Unity**
Cialdini adds "Unity" to his list of influence weapons. We say yes to people we share an identity with (Family, Heritage, Location, Shared Interests).

**Conclusion**
Persuasion is not about what you say; it’s about how you set the stage.

**Title:** The Secret to Influencing People (Before You Even Speak)

**[0:00-2:00] The Sofa Experiment**
*   **Host:** "Researchers put two different backgrounds on a sofa website. One had fluffy clouds. One had pennies. People who saw the clouds bought soft, expensive sofas. People who saw the pennies bought cheap, hard ones. They didn't even notice the background. This is *Pre-Suasion*."

**[2:00-5:00] Focus is Importance**
*   **Host:** "Whatever you focus on, you think is important. If I ask you about your health, you'll start thinking health is the most important thing in your life. Pre-suaders use this by directing your attention to a specific feature *before* they ask for the sale."

**[5:00-7:30] If/Then Planning**
*   **Host:** "How do you use this on yourself? Use 'If/Then' plans. 'If the waiter asks if I want dessert, Then I will order mint tea.' You are pre-suading your future self."

**[7:30-9:00] The Unity Principle**
*   **Host:** "The new principle is Unity. We help people who are 'like us.' Not just 'similar' to us, but part of our 'we.' Using the word 'we' or 'us' builds an instant bond that makes persuasion easy."

**[9:00-10:00] Conclusion**
*   **Host:** "Set the stage. Change the focus. Get the yes."

**Script 1: What is Pre-Suasion?**
*   **Audio:** "The best communicators don't just have a great message. They prepare the audience to receive it. This is Pre-Suasion. It’s the art of directing attention *before* the request. If you want someone to be helpful, ask them 'Do you consider yourself a helpful person?' first. Their brain will find evidence that they are, making them much more likely to say yes when you ask for help."

**Script 2: Attention is Value**
*   **Audio:** "Your brain is easily tricked. Whatever you are paying attention to right now, you think is the most important thing in the world. Marketers know this. If they want you to buy a car for safety, they’ll show you a video of a crash before talking about the price. They prime your brain to value safety. Control the focus, and you control the choice."

**Script 3: The Cloud vs Penny Test**
*   **Audio:** "Does your website background matter? Yes. An experiment showed that putting clouds on a furniture site made people buy comfortable sofas. Putting pennies made them buy the cheapest ones. We think we are making rational choices, but we are actually being guided by the environment. Design your space to support your goals."

**Script 4: The Unity Principle**
*   **Audio:** "The 7th rule of persuasion is Unity. We don't just like people who are similar to us; we help people who are 'one of us.' This is the 'We' feeling. Whether it's family, a sports team, or a shared struggle. If you can show someone that you are on the same team, the barriers to persuasion vanish. Focus on the 'We.'"

**Script 5: The Mystery Hook**
*   **Audio:** "Why are some stories so addictive? The Mystery Hook. Start with a puzzle. Something that doesn't make sense. Your brain hates an unfinished story—it’s called the Zeigarnik effect. If you start your presentation with a mystery, people will pay attention until the very end just to get the answer. Use curiosity as your pre-suasive tool."
