# I'm OK – You're OK by Thomas A. Harris

## 1. Long Detailed Summary for Blog

**Title:** A Practical Guide to Transactional Analysis: *I'm OK – You're OK*

**Introduction**
Building on Eric Berne’s work, Thomas Harris explores the four life positions that dictate how we interact with the world. We all start life in the "I'm Not OK – You're OK" position (because we are small and helpless babies). The goal of maturity is to consciously move to the "I'm OK – You're OK" position.

**The Four Life Positions**
1.  **I'm Not OK – You're OK:** The position of the child. Feelings of inferiority and seeking approval.
2.  **I'm Not OK – You're Not OK:** The position of despair. Feelings of hopelessness.
3.  **I'm OK – You're Not OK:** The position of the bully. Feelings of superiority to mask underlying insecurity.
4.  **I'm OK – You're OK:** The position of the healthy adult. Acceptance of self and others.

**Key Insights**
*   **The Recording:** Our brain records every event and emotion from our childhood. These "recordings" play back when we are stressed.
*   **Adult Control:** The Adult ego state can choose to ignore the recordings of the Parent and Child.
*   **Empathy:** Realizing that everyone else is also struggling with their own "I'm Not OK" recordings.

**Conclusion**
You are not a victim of your past. You can choose your life position today.

**Title:** The 4 Life Positions (I'm OK - You're OK Summary)

**[0:00-2:00] The Baby's World**
*   **Host:** "When you were a baby, you were 'Not OK.' You couldn't walk, talk, or feed yourself. But your parents were 'OK.' They were like gods. Thomas Harris says most of us grow up but we never leave that feeling of being 'Not OK.' Today we learn how to fix our life position."

**[2:00-5:00] The 4 Positions**
*   **Host:** "There are 4 ways to see the world. 1. **I'm Not OK, You're OK** (I’m a loser, you’re great). 2. **I'm Not OK, You're Not OK** (Life is terrible for everyone). 3. **I'm OK, You're Not OK** (I’m the best, everyone else is stupid). And 4. **I'm OK, You're OK**. This is the only position that leads to happiness."

**[5:00-7:30] The Brain is a Tape Recorder**
*   **Host:** "Harris says your brain records everything. Every time your mom yelled at you, it’s on the tape. Every time you felt small, it’s on the tape. When someone criticizes you today, your brain 'plays back' the old recording. You feel like that 5-year-old again. You have to realize it’s just a recording. It’s not reality."

**[7:30-9:00] Switching to Adult**
*   **Host:** "The Adult part of your brain can stop the tape. When you feel that 'Not OK' feeling, stop. Ask: 'Is this recording true? Or am I just replaying the past?' You have to use logic to stay in the present. You have to choose to be OK."

**[9:00-10:00] Conclusion**
*   **Host:** "You are OK. I am OK. Let’s start there."

**Script 1: I'm Not OK**
*   **Audio:** "Do you constantly feel like everyone else has it figured out and you don't? You are stuck in the 'I'm Not OK – You're OK' position. It’s a leftover feeling from when you were a baby. It was true then, but it’s not true now. You are an adult. You have power. Stop looking up to everyone else and start looking them in the eye."

**Script 2: The Bully Position**
*   **Audio:** "The person who is always complaining and putting others down is usually the most insecure. They are in the 'I'm OK – You're Not OK' position. It’s a defense mechanism. They make you 'Not OK' so they can feel superior. Don't be intimidated by them. Their arrogance is just a mask for their fear. Stay in your own 'OK' lane."

**Script 3: The Brain's Tape Recorder**
*   **Audio:** "Your brain is a tape recorder that never stops. It has recorded every criticism and every failure from your childhood. When you feel a sudden wave of shame, that's just an old tape playing. You can't erase the tape, but you can choose not to listen. Realize that your 'feelings' are often just echoes of the past. Stay in the present."

**Script 4: I'm OK - You're OK**
*   **Audio:** "The goal of life is the fourth position: I'm OK – You're OK. It means I accept my flaws and I accept yours. I don't need to win, and I don't need to hide. It sounds simple, but it is the hardest thing to achieve. It requires a conscious decision every single day to see the value in yourself and others."

**Script 5: Use Your Adult**
*   **Audio:** "When you're in a conflict, your 'Inner Child' wants to cry and your 'Inner Parent' wants to yell. Don't let them. Call on your 'Inner Adult.' The Adult doesn't have emotions; the Adult has data. The Adult asks 'What is the actual problem here?'. Use your logic to override your history. Be the Adult in the room."
