# Show Your Work! by Austin Kleon

## 1. Long Detailed Summary for Blog

**Title:** How to Get Discovered: *Show Your Work!*

**Introduction**
In the sequel to *Steal Like an Artist*, Kleon addresses the problem of self-promotion. He argues that you don't have to be a genius to share your work. You just need to be an amateur who is willing to share the process.

**Key Insights**
1.  **You Don't Have to Be a Genius:** Be an amateur. Amateurs are excited. They share what they are learning.
2.  **Share the Process:** Don't just show the finished product. Show the sketches, the drafts, the mistakes. People love the "Behind the Scenes."
3.  **Small Daily Acts:** Post one thing every day. A tweet, a photo, a thought. Over a year, this becomes a body of work.
4.  **Teach What You Know:** Teaching doesn't create competition; it creates connection.

**Conclusion**
Don't wait until you're "ready." Share your journey now.

## 3. Short Form Video Scripts (30-60 Seconds)

**Script 1: Process over Product**
*   **Audio:** "Stop hiding your work until it's perfect. People don't just want the art; they want the artist. Show your process. Show the messy desk. Show the bad drafts. When you share the journey, you build an audience that cares about *you*, not just the product."

**Script 2: Learn in Public**
*   **Audio:** "You don't have to be an expert to teach. In fact, sometimes it's better if you aren't. 'The Scenius' values the amateur who says 'Look what I just figured out!' Share what you learn as you learn it. You will help the people who are one step behind you."

**Script 3: Send a Daily Dispatch**
*   **Audio:** "How do you build a following? Consistency. Austin Kleon suggests a 'Daily Dispatch.' Post one thing every day. A quote. A sketch. A photo. It takes 5 minutes. But after a year, you have a portfolio. Small steps, massive results."

**Script 4: Don't Be Human Spam**
*   **Audio:** "If you only talk about yourself, you are human spam. 'Buy my book!' 'Listen to my song!' Stop it. Be a curator. Share other people's work. Share what inspires you. If you want to be interesting, be interested."

**Script 5: The Vampire Test**
*   **Audio:** "How do you know who to keep in your life? Use the Vampire Test. After you hang out with someone, do you feel energized or drained? If you feel drained, they are a vampire. You cannot cure vampirism. You can only banish them. Protect your energy."
