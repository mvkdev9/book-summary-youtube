**Title:** 8 Conversations Every Couple Must Have

**[0:00-2:00] The Date Night Problem**
*   **Host:** "Most couples go on 'Date Nights' and talk about the kids or their schedule. That is not a date; that is a board meeting. John Gottman says you need to have 8 specific conversations to keep your love alive."

**[2:00-5:00] Date 1 & 2: Trust and Conflict**
*   **Host:** "Date 1 is about **Trust**. Do you feel safe? Date 2 is about **Conflict**. Most people avoid talking about fighting until they are *in* a fight. That’s too late. You need to talk about *how* you fight when you are calm. What are the rules of engagement?"

**[5:00-7:30] Date 4: Money**
*   **Host:** "Money is the #1 reason for divorce. But it’s not about the dollar amount. It’s about the *meaning* of money. For some, money is safety. For others, it’s freedom. You have to understand your partner's 'Money Story' to stop the arguments."

**[7:30-9:00] Date 8: Dreams**
*   **Host:** "The final date is the best one: **Dreams**. What do you want to achieve before you die? If you support your partner's dreams, they will love you forever. If you mock them or ignore them, the relationship will wither."

**[9:00-10:00] Conclusion**
*   **Host:** "Schedule Date #1 tonight. Put the phones away. Just talk."

**Script 1: Date or Meeting?**
*   **Audio:** "Is your date night just a logistics meeting? If you spend the whole dinner talking about the mortgage, the kids, and the grocery list, you are doing it wrong. A date is for discovery. Use the 8 Dates method. Pick one topic—like 'Fun' or 'Dreams'—and forbid yourself from talking about chores. Reconnect with the person, not the problems."

**Script 2: The Meaning of Money**
*   **Audio:** "Why do you fight about money? It’s probably not the price tag. It’s the meaning. In the 8 Dates book, Gottman says we each have a 'Money Story.' Maybe you grew up poor, so money means safety. Maybe your partner grew up restricted, so money means freedom. Stop fighting about the math and start talking about the history. Understanding kills the conflict."

**Script 3: Open-Ended Questions**
*   **Audio:** "Want to have a better conversation? Stop asking 'Yes/No' questions. Instead of 'Did you have a good day?', ask 'What was the most interesting part of your day?' Instead of 'Do you like this?', ask 'How does this make you feel?' Open-ended questions are the keys that unlock your partner’s inner world. Be a detective, not an interviewer."

**Script 4: Support the Dream**
*   **Audio:** "The secret to a long-lasting marriage is being a 'Dream Supporter.' Does your partner want to write a book? Start a bakery? Travel the world? Don't be the 'realistic' person who shuts them down. Be the person who asks: 'How can I help you get there?' When you protect your partner’s dreams, you protect the relationship."

**Script 5: Conflict is Opportunity**
*   **Audio:** "Stop trying to avoid conflict. It’s impossible! 69% of problems are perpetual. The goal isn't to stop fighting; the goal is to fight well. Talk about your conflict style on a date when you're NOT mad. Learn each other's triggers. Conflict is just an opportunity to understand each other on a deeper level. Lean into it."
