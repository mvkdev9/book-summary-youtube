# Think Like a Monk by Jay Shetty

## 1. Long Detailed Summary for Blog

**Title:** Ancient Wisdom for Modern Times: *Think Like a Monk*

**Introduction**
Jay Shetty, a former monk turned social media star, bridges the gap between the ashram and the office in *Think Like a Monk*. The book offers practical steps to train your mind for peace and purpose every day. It’s about clearing the noise to hear your own voice.

**Core Concepts**

1.  **Identity and Values:**
    *   Shetty asks, "Who are you?" He uses the concept of the "looking-glass self"—we are what we think others think we are. To find our true self, we must audit our values. Are you chasing money because you want it, or because society told you to?

2.  **Negativity and Fear:**
    *   Monks learn to manage their mind. Shetty suggests "spot, stop, and swap." Spot the negative thought, stop it, and swap it for a positive or grateful one.
    *   Fear is not bad; it's a signal. Use fear to identify what you care about and prepare for it.

3.  **Intention and Purpose (Dharma):**
    *   Dharma is where your passion meets your skills and the world's needs. Formula: Passion + Expertise + Usefulness = Dharma.
    *   Living in your Dharma is the key to satisfaction.

4.  **Service (Seva):**
    *   The highest purpose of a monk is service. "Plant trees under whose shade you do not plan to sit." Selflessness heals the self.

**Conclusion**
*Think Like a Monk* demystifies spirituality. You don't have to live in a cave to find peace; you just need to adopt the "monk mindset"—focus, discipline, and service—in your daily life.

**Title:** How to Train Your Mind: Think Like a Monk by Jay Shetty

**[0:00-1:30] Intro**
*   **Host:** "Imagine pausing your life, shaving your head, and living as a monk for three years. That’s what Jay Shetty did. Then he came back to teach us what he learned."
*   **Host:** "*Think Like a Monk* is about applying ancient wisdom to our chaotic, digital lives."

**[1:30-4:00] Let Go of Identity**
*   **Host:** "Shetty talks about the 'Monkey Mind' vs. the 'Monk Mind.' The Monkey Mind is reactive, distracted, and seeks validation. The Monk Mind is focused, disciplined, and seeks purpose."
*   **Host:** "We spend so much time putting on masks. We try to impress people we don't like. Shetty says: Audit your life. Where did your desires come from? TV? Parents? Instagram? Clear the dust to find *you*."

**[4:00-6:30] Dealing with Negativity**
*   **Host:** "We all have that friend who complains constantly. Or maybe we are that friend. Shetty suggests the '25/75 Rule': For every negative person in your life, spend 75% of your time with uplifting people."
*   **Host:** "And for internal negativity? Don't suppress it. Address it. Treat it like a guest, but don't let it move in."

**[6:30-8:30] Finding Your Dharma**
*   **Host:** "This is the best part of the book. Dharma. It’s your calling. How do you find it? Look at what you are good at, what you love, and what helps others. If you can align those three, you win the game of life."

**[8:30-10:00] Conclusion**
*   **Host:** "You don't need robes to be a monk. You just need intention. Start your day with gratitude, serve others, and watch your anxiety drop. Thanks for watching."

**Script 1: Spot, Stop, Swap**
*   **Audio:** "Got a negative thought? Try the Monk method: Spot, Stop, Swap. First, **Spot** the thought ('I am going to fail'). Second, **Stop** it (Visualise a stop sign). Third, **Swap** it ('I am prepared and I will do my best'). You can rewire your brain one thought at a time. Be the guard at the gate of your mind."

**Script 2: What is Dharma?**
*   **Audio:** "Are you lost in life? You might be missing your Dharma. Jay Shetty defines Dharma as Passion + Expertise + Usefulness. What do you love? What are you good at? And how does that help the world? When you find the intersection of those three things, you find your purpose. Don't just work for a paycheck. Work for your Dharma."
