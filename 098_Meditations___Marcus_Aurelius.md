**[0:00-2:00] The Philosopher King**
*   **Host:** "Imagine the most powerful person in the world. He controls the entire Roman Empire. He has infinite money and infinite power. What does he write about in his diary? He writes about how to be a better person. This is Marcus Aurelius, and this is his *Meditations*."

**[2:00-5:00] Control Your Mind**
*   **Host:** "Marcus says: 'The soul becomes dyed with the color of its thoughts.' He reminds himself constantly that external events have no power over him. If someone insults him, it only hurts if he *chooses* to be hurt. This is the ultimate superpower: total control over your own reaction."

**[5:00-7:30] Dealing with Difficult People**
*   **Host:** "Every morning, Marcus wrote: 'Today I will meet people who are nosy, ungrateful, arrogant, and mean.' He didn't say this to be a jerk; he said it to be ready. He knew that difficult people are just confused. His job was to lead them and help them, not to get angry at them."

**Script 1: Dye Your Soul**
*   **Audio:** "Marcus Aurelius said: 'The soul becomes dyed with the color of its thoughts.' If you think about anger and revenge, your soul becomes dark. If you think about gratitude and duty, your soul becomes bright. You are the artist of your own mind. Choose your colors carefully today."

**Script 2: Dealing with Jerks**
*   **Audio:** "Next time someone is rude to you, use the Marcus Aurelius method. He said: 'The best revenge is to be unlike him who performed the injury.' If they are mean, you be kind. If they are loud, you stay quiet. Don't let their bad behavior change your character. Stay true to yourself."

**Script 3: The Morning Routine**
*   **Audio:** "Start your day with this Stoic realization: 'When you wake up in the morning, tell yourself: The people I deal with today will be meddling, ungrateful, arrogant, dishonest, jealous, and surly.' Expect the chaos. When it happens, you won't be surprised, and you won't lose your peace. Preparation is the mother of calm."

**Script 4: It’s Not the Event**
*   **Audio:** "Marcus Aurelius taught that it’s never the event that hurts us; it’s our opinion *about* the event. If you lose your job, that’s just a fact. If you decide it's a 'disaster,' then it hurts. You can't always control what happens, but you can always control the story you tell yourself. Change the story, stop the pain."

**Script 5: Do Every Act as the Last**
*   **Audio:** "Stop procrastinating your life. Marcus Aurelius said: 'Do every act of your life as though it were the very last act of your life.' If this was your last hour, would you be scrolling? Would you be complaining? Live with urgency. Live with excellence. The present moment is the only thing you actually own."
