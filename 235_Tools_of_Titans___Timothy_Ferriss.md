**Title:** Habits of the World's Best (Tools of Titans Summary)

**[0:00-2:00] The Billionaire's Secrets**
*   **Host:** "Tim Ferriss has interviewed 200 of the smartest people on Earth. Billionaires like Peter Thiel, athletes like Arnold Schwarzenegger, and icons like Jamie Foxx. He found that they all have 'Success Recipes.' This is the cookbook: *Tools of Titans*."

**[2:00-5:00] The Morning Routine**
*   **Host:** "80% of these 'Titans' do some form of meditation. They don't wake up and check their phone. They wake up and check their mind. They also do simple things: they make their bed (a small win), they do 10 pushups, and they drink a 'Titan' tea. They win the first 60 minutes so they can win the next 16 hours."

**[5:00-7:30] Focus on the Odd**
*   **Host:** "Success isn't about being 'normal.' It’s about leaning into your 'Oddness.' Jocko Willink wakes up at 4:30 AM every day. Wim Hof swims in ice. These people find a 'Tool' that works for *them* and they do it obsessively. What is your 'Weird' superpower? Find it and double down."

**[7:30-9:00] Ask Better Questions**
*   **Host:** "The quality of your life is the quality of your questions. Thiel asks: 'If you have a 10-year plan, why can't you do it in 6 months?' Naval Ravikant asks: 'If you could be anyone else, would you take their problems too?' These questions force you to 'Think Again' and find shortcuts."

**[9:00-10:00] Conclusion**
*   **Host:** "You don't need to be a Titan. You just need to borrow their tools."

## 3. Short Form Video Scripts (30-60 Seconds)

**Script 1: Success is a Recipe**
*   **Audio:** "Success isn't luck. It’s a recipe. Tim Ferriss found that the world’s top performers all use the same 'ingredients.' 80% meditate. Most have a strict morning routine. And all of them have a 'system' for handling failure. You don't have to reinvent the wheel. Just find someone who has the results you want and steal their tools. Success leaves clues."

**Script 2: Make Your Bed**
*   **Audio:** "Why does every billionaire tell you to make your bed? Because it’s the first 'Win' of the day. When you make your bed, you have accomplished the first task of the morning. It gives you a small sense of pride and encourages you to do another task, and another. If you can't do the little things right, you'll never do the big things right. Start small."

**Script 3: The 10-Year Question**
*   **Audio:** "Peter Thiel has a question that will change your life: 'If you have a 10-year goal, why can't you achieve it in 6 months?' Of course, you probably can't. But the *question* forces you to think of 'impossible' shortcuts. It forces you to realize that most of what you're doing is just 'busy work.' Speed up your thinking to speed up your results."

**Script 4: Fear Setting**
*   **Audio:** "Stop setting goals and start setting fears. Write down the absolute worst thing that could happen if you take that risk. Now, write down how you would fix it if it happened. Usually, the 'disaster' is temporary and reversible. Once you realize you won't die, you become free to act. Fear is a ghost—turn on the light and it disappears."

**Script 5: Scratch Your Own Itch**
*   **Audio:** "The best business ideas come from 'Scratching Your Own Itch.' If you have a problem, and there is no product to solve it—build it! 90% of the 'Titans' in Tim Ferriss’s book started by solving a problem for themselves. Don't look for a 'market gap.' Look for a 'life gap.' If you need it, thousands of others probably do too."
