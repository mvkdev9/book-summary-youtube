**Title:** Stop Procrastinating and Get More Done: Lessons from *Eat That Frog!*

**Introduction**
Brian Tracy’s *Eat That Frog!* is one of the most famous productivity books ever written. The title comes from a Mark Twain quote: "If it's your job to eat a frog, it's best to do it first thing in the morning. And If it's your job to eat two frogs, it's best to eat the biggest one first." The "frog" is your biggest, most important task—the one you are most likely to procrastinate on.

**The 21 Great Ways to Stop Procrastinating**
Tracy outlines 21 principles, but the core philosophy revolves around clarity and priority.
1.  **Set the Table:** Decide exactly what you want. Clarity is power. Write your goals down.
2.  **Plan Every Day in Advance:** Every minute spent in planning saves 10 minutes in execution. Use the "6-P Formula": Proper Prior Planning Prevents Poor Performance.
3.  **The 80/20 Rule:** Apply the Pareto Principle. 20% of your tasks account for 80% of the value. Focus on those.
4.  **Consider Consequences:** Long-time perspective is the most common characteristic of high performers. Ask: "What are the potential consequences of doing or not doing this task?"
5.  **The ABCDE Method:** Rank your tasks.
    *   A: Must do (Serious consequences).
    *   B: Should do (Mild consequences).
    *   C: Nice to do (No consequences).
    *   D: Delegate.
    *   E: Eliminate.
    *   *Rule: Never do a B task when an A task is left undone.*

**Key Concepts**
*   **Focus on Key Result Areas (KRAs):** Identify the 5-7 things you were hired to do. If you fail at these, you fail at your job.
*   **Technological Time Drains:** Turn off notifications. Technology is a terrible master.
*   **Single Handle:** Once you start a task, keep working on it until it is 100% complete.

**Conclusion**
Success isn't about doing everything; it's about doing the *right* things. Identify your frog, and eat it immediately.

**[0:00-1:30] The Mark Twain Quote**
*   **Host:** "Mark Twain once said, 'If it's your job to eat a frog, it's best to do it first thing in the morning.' Why? because if you start your day by eating a live, slimy frog, you can go through the rest of the day knowing the worst is behind you."
*   **Host:** "In Brian Tracy’s classic *Eat That Frog!*, the frog is your biggest, ugliest task. The one you are dreading. The one that actually moves the needle. And today, we are going to learn how to eat it."

**[1:30-3:30] Clarity & Planning**
*   **Host:** "The number one reason for procrastination is lack of clarity. We don't know exactly what we need to do. Step 1: Set the Table. Write down exactly what you want. A goal not written down is just a wish."
*   **Host:** "Step 2: Plan your day the night before. Tracy says every minute of planning saves 10 minutes of execution. Make a list. If you wake up without a plan, you are already behind."

**[3:30-6:00] The ABCDE Method**

*   **Host:** "The Golden Rule: Never do a B task when an A task is left undone. Discipline yourself to work on the A1 task until it is finished."

**[6:00-8:00] The Law of Forced Efficiency**
*   **Host:** "There is never enough time to do everything, but there is always enough time to do the most important thing. This is the Law of Forced Efficiency. Stop trying to clear your to-do list. You never will. Just focus on the top 20% of tasks that yield 80% of the results."

**[8:00-10:00] Single Handling & Conclusion**
*   **Host:** "Finally, practice 'Single Handling.' Once you start the Frog, do not stop until it is eaten. Don't switch apps. Don't check your phone. 100% completion."

**Script 2: The ABCDE Method**
*   **Audio:** "Your to-do list is a mess. Fix it with the ABCDE method. A is 'Must Do'—serious consequences. B is 'Should Do'. C is 'Nice to Do'. D is 'Delegate'. E is 'Eliminate'. The rule? Never do a B task when you have an A task left. Stop clearing low-value tasks just to feel busy. Tackle the A1 task first."

**Script 3: Plan the Night Before**
*   **Audio:** "Want to double your productivity tomorrow? Spend 10 minutes tonight planning it. Brian Tracy says every minute of planning saves 10 minutes of execution.

This is the Law of Forced Efficiency. Stop stressing about the unfinished low-value work. As long as you are crushing the top 20% of your tasks, you are winning."

**Script 5: Single Handling**
*   **Audio:** "The fastest way to finish a task is to start it and not stop until it is 100% done. It’s called Single Handling. Every time you stop and start, you lose momentum and time. Pick your task. Turn off the phone. Lock the door. And don't stop until it's finished. Focus is a muscle—train it."
