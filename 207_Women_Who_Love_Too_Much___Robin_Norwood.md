## 1. Long Detailed Summary for Blog

**Title:** When You Keep Wishing and Hoping He'll Change: *Women Who Love Too Much*

**Introduction**
Robin Norwood addresses a specific pattern of addiction: the addiction to a "difficult" partner. Many women find themselves repeatedly attracted to men who are unavailable, unstable, or cold. They believe that if they just love him "enough," he will change. This is "Loving Too Much."

**Key Insights**
1.  **Love as Addiction:** The obsession with a man becomes a drug. The drama provides the high; the distance provides the withdrawal.
2.  **Roots in Childhood:** We look for partners who recreate the familiar pain of our childhood. We try to "win" this time where we lost as a child.
3.  **The Fixer:** Loving too much is a quest for power and control disguised as love.
4.  **Recovery:** Recovery means moving the focus from the man to the Self. It involves a 10-step program including group support and self-care.

**Conclusion**
You don't need a project; you need a partner. Stop trying to earn love and start finding it in yourself.

**Title:** Why You Are Attracted to Toxic Men (Norwood Summary)

**[0:00-2:00] The Obsession**
*   **Host:** "Does your relationship feel like a full-time job? Do you spend all your time analyzing his texts, worrying about his mood, and trying to 'fix' him? Robin Norwood says you aren't 'in love.' You are addicted. This is *Women Who Love Too Much*."

**[2:00-5:00] Recreating the Past**
*   **Host:** "Why do we pick the hard guys? Norwood says we are trying to solve our childhood. If you had a father who was cold or absent, you will look for a husband who is cold or absent. You think: 'If I can make *him* love me, it will prove I'm worthy.' You are trying to rewrite a story that has already ended."

**[5:00-7:30] Love isn't Struggle**
*   **Host:** "We think that if a relationship is easy, it's boring. We mistake 'Anxiety' for 'Passion.' But real love isn't a struggle. Real love is stable. If you only feel 'alive' when there is drama and pain, you are a relationship junkie."

**[7:30-9:00] How to Stop**
*   **Host:** "Step 1: Stop focusing on him. His problems are his business. Step 2: Find a support group. You need to talk to other women who have the same 'disease.' Step 3: Prioritize your own life. When you become the center of your own universe, the toxic people naturally fall away."

**[9:00-10:00] Conclusion**
*   **Host:** "You deserve to be loved, not managed. Choose peace."

**Script 1: Are You Loving Too Much?**
*   **Audio:** "If a relationship doesn't hurt, do you think it's not real? If you spend more time talking about him than living your own life, you are 'loving too much.' This isn't devotion; it’s an addiction. You are using the drama of his life to avoid the reality of your own. Stop being a rescuer and start being your own hero."

**Script 2: The Childhood Mirror**
*   **Audio:** "Why do you keep dating the same guy with a different name? Because you are looking for a mirror of your past. We are drawn to the familiar, even if it's painful. If you were neglected as a child, you'll feel attracted to neglectful men. Break the spell. Realize that 'familiar' doesn't mean 'right.' You have the power to choose a new story."

**Script 3: Anxiety is not Chemistry**
*   **Audio:** "Don't confuse butterflies with red flags. That 'intensity' you feel for a difficult man isn't love; it’s anxiety. Your nervous system is triggered. Real love feels like home—it’s calm, safe, and supportive. If you have to fight for his attention, he is not the one. Stop chasing the high and start looking for the peace."

**Script 4: You Can't Fix Him**
*   **Audio:** "Here is a truth that might hurt: Your love will never be enough to change him. Only he can change himself. If you are waiting for him to wake up and see your worth, you are wasting your life. Stop being his therapist and start being his partner. If he can't meet you halfway, walk away."

**Script 5: Move the Focus**
*   **Audio:** "How to recover from a toxic relationship? Move the focus. Every time you think about him, stop. Ask: 'What am I feeling right now? What do I need?'. By moving the spotlight from his problems to your potential, you break the addiction. You are the most important person in your life. Start acting like it."
