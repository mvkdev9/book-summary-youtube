**Title:** How Bob Iger Saved Disney (Ride of a Lifetime Summary)

**[0:00-2:00] The Acquisition King**
*   **Host:** "In 2005, Disney was in trouble. They were fighting with Pixar. Their movies were failing. They were a mess. Then, Bob Iger took over. In 15 years, he bought Pixar, Marvel, Star Wars, and Fox. He turned Disney into the most powerful media company in history. Today we look at his rules for leadership: *The Ride of a Lifetime*."

**[2:00-5:00] Focus: The Rule of Three**
*   **Host:** "When Iger became CEO, he told the board he only had **Three Priorities**. 1. High-quality content. 2. Use new technology. 3. Go global. Most CEOs have a list of 50 goals. Iger says if you have 50 goals, you have zero goals. You have to be ruthless about where you spend your energy. Focus is the only way to move a giant ship."

**[5:00-7:30] The Pixar Gamble**
*   **Host:** "Iger's first big move was buying Pixar. It cost \$7.4 billion. People thought he was crazy. But Iger knew that if he didn't fix Disney's animation, the whole brand would die. He had the **Courage** to take a massive risk. But he also had the **Humility** to let Steve Jobs and John Lasseter keep their culture. He didn't 'Disney-fy' Pixar; he 'Pixar-fied' Disney."

**[7:30-9:00] Optimism as a Strategy**
*   **Host:** "Iger says: 'Optimism is a pragmatic strategy.' If you are the leader and you look worried, the whole company will panic. You have to believe that a solution exists. You don't ignore the problems, but you never lose faith in the mission. Your energy is the engine of the organization."

**[9:00-10:00] Conclusion**
*   **Host:** "Lead with integrity. Be bold. Dream big."

## 3. Short Form Video Scripts (30-60 Seconds)

**Script 1: The Rule of Three**
*   **Audio:** "What is the secret to leading a multi-billion dollar company? Focus. When Bob Iger took over Disney, he only had 3 goals. Not 10, not 50. Three. If you have too many priorities, you have none. Write down the 3 most important things in your life or your business today and ignore everything else. Success is the result of concentrated force."

**Script 2: Optimism is Pragmatic**
*   **Audio:** "Are you a pessimistic leader? Stop. Bob Iger says that pessimism is a disease. If you don't believe in the future, your team won't either. They will stop taking risks and start playing safe. Optimism isn't about being naive; it’s about choosing to focus on the solution instead of the problem. A leader’s energy is contagious. Make sure yours is worth catching."

**Script 3: The Integrity Test**
*   **Audio:** "How you do anything is how you do everything. Bob Iger says that integrity is the only thing that lasts. In the high-stakes world of Disney acquisitions, trust was his only currency. He bought Marvel and Lucasfilm because the owners trusted HIM personally. Don't cut corners. Don't lie. Your reputation is your most valuable asset. Protect it with your life."

**Script 4: Innovate or Die**
*   **Audio:** "Disney+ was a huge risk. Disney had to cannibalize their own cable business to build it. But Bob Iger knew that if they didn't embrace the future, they would become a dinosaur. You have to be willing to disrupt yourself before someone else does it for you. Don't get attached to your old success. Keep looking for the next wave."

**Script 5: Empathy in Business**
*   **Audio:** "Business is about people, not just numbers. When Bob Iger bought Pixar, he spent months building a relationship with Steve Jobs. He cared about Pixar’s culture as much as their profits. If you want to build an empire, you have to be fair and empathetic. Treat your partners like family, and they will help you reach heights you can't reach alone."
