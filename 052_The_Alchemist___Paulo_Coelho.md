**Script 4: Listen to Your Heart**
*   **Audio:** "You will never be able to escape from your heart. So you'd better listen to what it has to say. Your heart knows your dreams. It knows your fears. If you try to ignore it, it will always be there, whispering. Make peace with your heart and let it lead you."
