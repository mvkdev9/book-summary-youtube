# Steal Like an Artist by Austin Kleon

## 1. Long Detailed Summary for Blog

**Title:** 10 Things Nobody Told You About Being Creative: *Steal Like an Artist*

**Introduction**
Austin Kleon argues that nothing is original. All creative work builds on what came before. The key is to steal like an artist, not like a plagiarist.

**Key Insights**
1.  **Steal Like an Artist:** Good theft is honoring, studying, and transforming. Bad theft is degrading and skimming. Don't steal from one; steal from many.
2.  **Fake It 'Til You Make It:** You start by copying your heroes. Eventually, you fail to copy them perfectly, and that failure becomes your own style.
3.  **Side Projects:** The things you do when you are procrastinating are often your best work.
4.  **Be Boring:** Creativity requires a lot of energy. Be boring in your regular life (pay bills, stay married) so you can be wild in your work.

**Conclusion**
Creativity is subtraction. It’s what you choose to leave out.

**Title:** Nothing is Original (And That's Good News)

**[0:00-2:00] Everything is a Remix**
*   **Host:** "What if I told you that originality is a myth? Austin Kleon says: 'Everything that needs to be said has already been said.' This is *Steal Like an Artist*."

**[2:00-5:00] Good Theft vs. Bad Theft**
*   **Host:** "Bad theft is copy-paste. Good theft is transformation. If you copy one person, it’s plagiarism. If you copy 100 people, it’s research. Build your own 'Genealogy of Ideas.' Who influenced your hero? Study *them*."

**[5:00-7:30] Use Your Hands**
*   **Host:** "Computers kill creativity. They are too perfect. Step away from the screen. Use markers, paper, scissors. When you move your hands, you move your brain."

**[7:30-9:00] Be Boring**
*   **Host:** "Flaubert said: 'Be regular and orderly in your life, so that you may be violent and original in your work.' You don't need a drug habit to be an artist. You need a budget and a good night's sleep."

**[9:00-10:00] Conclusion**
*   **Host:** "Start stealing today. Remix the world."

## 3. Short Form Video Scripts (30-60 Seconds)

**Script 1: Steal From Many**
*   **Audio:** "If you steal from one person, it’s plagiarism. If you steal from many, it’s research. Austin Kleon says: 'Steal Like an Artist.' Take a beat from here, a color from there, a quote from there. Mash them together. That is creativity. Nothing comes from nowhere."

**Script 2: Fake It 'Til You Make It**
*   **Audio:** "You learn to write by copying the alphabet. You learn to paint by copying the masters. Don't be afraid to copy your heroes. You will fail to copy them perfectly. And in that gap—where you fail to be them—you will find yourself."

**Script 3: Be Boring**
*   **Audio:** "The myth of the crazy, drug-addicted artist is dead. To be prolific, you need to be boring. Pay your bills. Do the dishes. Go to sleep. Save your wild energy for the page. A chaotic life usually leads to chaotic work (or no work)."

**Script 4: Side Projects**
*   **Audio:** "What do you do when you're procrastinating? That is your real work. Austin Kleon says: 'The side projects are the main projects.' Pay attention to where your mind wanders. That is where your passion lives. Don't throw away your hobbies."

**Script 5: Creativity is Subtraction**
*   **Audio:** "In the age of information overload, you don't need *more*. You need *less*. Creativity is subtraction. It’s choosing what to leave out. It’s setting limits. 'I will write a song with only 3 chords.' 'I will paint with only blue.' Limits force you to be inventive."
