**Title:** Why We Are Bad at Predicting Happiness: *Stumbling on Happiness*

**Introduction**
Harvard psychologist Daniel Gilbert argues that humans are the only animals that can think about the future. However, we are terrible at predicting what will actually make our future selves happy. We suffer from "Prospection" errors.

**The Three Errors of Imagination**
1.  **Filling In:** Our brains fill in details about the future that aren't there. We imagine the "Big Day" but forget the "Small Hassles" (like the traffic on the way to the wedding).
2.  **Leaving Out:** We forget to imagine the things that *won't* happen.
3.  **Presentism:** We use our current feelings to predict how we will feel in the future. (e.g., shopping while hungry makes you buy too much food).

**Key Insights**
*   **Impact Bias:** We overestimate how much a future event (win or loss) will affect us. Winning the lottery won't make you a saint; losing your legs won't make you a hermit. We have a "Psychological Immune System" that returns us to baseline.
*   **The Best Strategy:** Instead of imagining the future, look at someone who is *currently* experiencing what you are planning. Ask them how they feel. This is called "Surrogation."

**Conclusion**
Trust others' experiences more than your own imagination.

**Title:** Why You Don't Know What You Want

**[0:00-2:00] The Future Self**
*   **Host:** "Think about what you wanted 10 years ago. Are you happy you got it? Probably not. Why? Because you are a terrible predictor of your own joy. This is *Stumbling on Happiness* by Daniel Gilbert."

**[2:00-5:00] The Imagination Problem**
*   **Host:** "When you imagine a vacation, you see yourself on the beach with a drink. You don't see the delayed flight, the sunburn, or the overpriced taxi. Your brain skips the boring parts. This is 'Filling In.' You are making a decision based on a highlight reel that doesn't exist."

**[5:00-7:30] Presentism**
*   **Host:** "Have you ever gone grocery shopping while you were starving? You bought enough food for an army. That is 'Presentism.' Your brain cannot imagine a future where you aren't hungry. We make the same mistake with our careers and relationships."

**[7:30-9:00] The Solution: Surrogation**
*   **Host:** "Stop using your imagination. It’s broken. Instead, find someone who is already doing the thing you want to do. If you want to be a lawyer, ask a lawyer if they are happy. Their reality is more accurate than your fantasy."

**[9:00-10:00] Conclusion**
*   **Host:** "Your brain is designed to keep you moving, not to make you happy. Don't trust it."

## 3. Short Form Video Scripts (30-60 Seconds)

**Script 1: Why You're Bad at Planning**
*   **Audio:** "You are terrible at predicting the future. Why? Because when you imagine a future event, your brain only shows you the highlights. You imagine the new house, but you forget the mortgage payments and the leaky roof. Daniel Gilbert calls this 'Filling In.' Stop trusting your imagination and start looking at the actual data."

**Script 2: Impact Bias**
*   **Audio:** "You think getting fired would be the end of the world. You think winning the lottery would be paradise. You're wrong on both. Humans have a 'Psychological Immune System.' We return to our baseline happiness much faster than we think. The highs aren't as high, and the lows aren't as low. Relax. You’ll be okay either way."

**Script 3: Grocery Shopping While Hungry**
*   **Audio:** "Don't shop when you're hungry. We all know the rule, but we don't know the science. It’s called 'Presentism.' Your brain uses your current feelings to predict the future. If you're hungry now, you think you'll be hungry forever. This is why we make bad decisions in relationships and jobs. Check your mood before you make a move."

**Script 4: The Surrogation Secret**
*   **Audio:** "Want to know if a job will make you happy? Don't imagine it. Find someone who has that job and ask them. Their experience is 'Surrogation.' It is 100 times more accurate than your imagination. If they are miserable, you will be too. Ignore your 'special' intuition and trust their reality."

**Script 5: The Happiness Gap**
*   **Audio:** "Why are we so busy but so unhappy? Because our brains evolved to make us survive and reproduce, not to make us happy. Your brain wants you to want things—money, status, power—even if they don't bring joy. Happiness is a stumble, not a destination. Stop chasing the 'next thing' and start noticing the 'now thing.'"
