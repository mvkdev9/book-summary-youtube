# Discourses by Epictetus

## 1. Long Detailed Summary for Blog

**Title:** The Art of Being Free: *Discourses*

**Introduction**
Epictetus was born a slave in the Roman Empire. He was crippled and lived in poverty for much of his life. Despite this, he became one of the most respected philosophers in history. His "Discourses" (recorded by his student Arrian) teach that freedom is an internal state. We are slaves to our desires and fears, but we can liberate ourselves through the use of reason.

**Key Insights**
1.  **The Dichotomy of Control:** Some things are "up to us" (our opinions, desires, and intentions) and some are "not up to us" (the body, property, reputation, and the actions of others). Realizing this is the first step to freedom.
2.  **The Role of Reason:** Our "faculty of choice" is our most precious possession. It is the only thing that is truly ours and cannot be taken away.
3.  **Expectations:** Unhappiness comes from expecting the world to conform to our wishes. Instead, we should conform our wishes to the world.
4.  **Character over Appearance:** It doesn't matter what people think of you. It only matters that you are acting according to your nature.
5.  **Preparation:** Life is like a play. Your job is to play the role you were given to the best of your ability, whether you are a beggar or a king.

**Conclusion**
No one can hurt you or imprison you if you realize that your true self is your mind.

**Title:** The Slave Who Taught an Emperor (Epictetus Summary)

**[0:00-2:00] From Slave to Philosopher**
*   **Host:** "Imagine being born a slave. Your leg is broken by your master. You own nothing. Most people would be full of hate and despair. But Epictetus wasn't. He used his situation to discover the ultimate secret of human freedom. He eventually became so wise that he taught Marcus Aurelius. Today we look at his *Discourses*."

**[2:00-5:00] The Core Lesson: What is Yours?**
*   **Host:** "Epictetus says: 'Some things are up to us, and some are not.' This is the only rule you need. You don't control your health (you can get sick). You don't control your money (the market can crash). You don't control your reputation. The only thing you truly own is your **faculty of choice**. Your opinions and your reactions. If you stop trying to control the world and start controlling your mind, you become a king."

**[5:00-7:30] The Price of Freedom**
*   **Host:** "Freedom has a price. To be free from worry, you have to stop caring about status and luxury. Epictetus once had an iron lamp stolen from his home. He didn't get mad. He said: 'The thief got the lamp, but I kept my peace.' He realized the thief paid for the lamp with his character. Which is more valuable?"

**[7:30-9:00] Life is a Play**
*   **Host:** "Epictetus says: 'Remember that you are an actor in a play.' You don't choose the role. You might be the hero, or the villain, or the guy who sweeps the floor. Your only job is to play that role well. If you are a waiter, be the best waiter. If you are a CEO, be the best CEO. Don't complain about the script; just perform."

**[9:00-10:00] Conclusion**
*   **Host:** "You are only a slave if you let the world control your emotions. Reclaim your freedom today."

## 3. Short Form Video Scripts (30-60 Seconds)

**Script 1: The One Rule**
*   **Audio:** "Epictetus was born a slave, but he was freer than the Emperor. Why? Because he followed one rule: 'Some things are up to us, and some are not.' You don't control the traffic, the weather, or your boss’s mood. Stop wasting energy on them. You control your attitude and your effort. Focus 100% on what you control, and 0% on what you don't. That is freedom."

**Script 2: You Are an Actor**
*   **Audio:** "Stop complaining about your life. Epictetus said: 'Life is like a play, and you are an actor.' You didn't choose the script. You didn't choose the role. But you DO choose how you perform. If you're a student, be a great student. If you're a parent, be a great parent. Don't wish for a different part; just play the one you've got with excellence."

**Script 3: The Stolen Lamp**
*   **Audio:** "Epictetus had his only lamp stolen. He didn't chase the thief. He said: 'He has the lamp, but I have my peace of mind.' He realized that everything external—your car, your phone, your house—is just a loan from the universe. One day, it will be taken back. If you tie your happiness to things, you are a slave. If you tie it to your character, you are free."

**Script 4: Don't Be Offended**
*   **Audio:** "Is someone insulting you? Epictetus says: 'No one can hurt you unless you allow it.' If someone calls you a name, it’s just a vibration in the air. It only hurts if you decide it's an insult. If you don't care about their opinion, they have no power over you. Stop giving strangers the remote control to your emotions."

**Script 5: Control Your Desire**
*   **Audio:** "The secret to happiness isn't getting what you want; it's wanting what you get. Epictetus taught that we suffer because we desire things that aren't in our control. We want the sun to shine, we want people to be nice, we want to be rich. Stop it. Desire only what is within your power—your own virtue. When you stop needing the world to be perfect, you find that it already is."
