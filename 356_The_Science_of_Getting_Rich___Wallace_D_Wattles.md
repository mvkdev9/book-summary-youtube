# The Science of Getting Rich by Wallace D. Wattles

## 1. Long Detailed Summary for Blog

**Title:** It is Your Duty to be Rich: *The Science of Getting Rich*

**Introduction**
Wallace D. Wattles wrote this book in 1910 with a bold claim: Getting rich is a science. If you follow the laws, you will get rich with mathematical certainty. It rejects the idea that poverty is spiritual. Instead, it argues that you can only live a full life (body, mind, and soul) if you have the resources to do so.

**Core Concepts**

1.  **The Right to be Rich:**
    *   God wants you to be rich. Why? Because God wants to express himself through you. He needs you to have brushes to paint, instruments to play, and money to travel. Poverty stunts God's expression.

2.  **The Certain Way:**
    *   You must think and act in a "Certain Way." This means moving from the Competitive Plane to the Creative Plane.
    *   **Competition:** Fighting for what already exists.
    *   **Creation:** Using your mind to create new value that didn't exist before.

3.  **Gratitude:**
    *   Gratitude connects you to the Source. If you are dissatisfied, you sever the connection. You must be grateful for what you have and for what is coming.

4.  **Action:**
    *   Thinking is half the battle. Action is the other half. "By thought, the thing you want is brought to you; by action, you receive it." You must fill your present place. Do your current job perfectly to overgrow it.

**Conclusion**
*The Science of Getting Rich* is a practical manifesto. It combines metaphysical visualization with hard work and excellence.
