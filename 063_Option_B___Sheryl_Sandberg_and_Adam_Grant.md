**Title:** How to Be Resilient (Lessons from Option B)

**[0:00-2:00] The Day Everything Changed**
*   **Host:** "Sheryl Sandberg had the perfect life. Great job, great husband, great kids. Then, while on vacation, her husband Dave died of a sudden heart attack. Her world collapsed. She thought she would never feel joy again."
*   **Host:** "But she learned that resilience isn't a trait; it's a practice. Today we look at *Option B*."

**[2:00-5:00] The 3 P's of Pain**
*   **Host:** "Adam Grant taught Sheryl that there are three things that keep us stuck in grief."
*   **1. Personalization:** "Thinking it's your fault. Even if it clearly wasn't."
*   **2. Pervasiveness:** "Thinking the sadness will ruin everything—your work, your hobbies, your parenting."
*   **3. Permanence:** "Thinking 'I will feel this way forever.'"
*   **Host:** "Realizing these are cognitive distortions is the first step to healing."

**[5:00-7:30] Building Resilience**
*   **Host:** "Resilience is like a muscle. You build it by taking small steps. Sheryl started by writing down 3 things she did well each day. Not 3 things she was grateful for—3 things she *did*. It rebuilt her confidence."

**[7:30-9:00] Post-Traumatic Growth**
*   **Host:** "We've heard of PTSD. But there is also PTG—Post-Traumatic Growth. Many people who go through hell come out with a deeper sense of meaning and stronger relationships. You can find beauty in the broken pieces."

**[9:00-10:00] Conclusion**
*   **Host:** "Life is going to break your heart. But when Option A is gone, you have to make the most of Option B."

## 3. Short Form Video Scripts (30-60 Seconds)

**Script 1: The 3 P's**
*   **Audio:** "Why can't you get over that setback? It might be the 3 P's. Personalization: You think it's your fault. Pervasiveness: You think it ruins everything. Permanence: You think it lasts forever. These are lies your brain tells you to keep you safe. But they actually keep you stuck. Challenge the 3 P's, and you'll find the strength to move on."

**Script 2: Resilience is a Muscle**
*   **Audio:** "You aren't born resilient. You become resilient. It’s a muscle you build when things go wrong. Every time you face a challenge and keep going, you are doing a 'rep' for your soul. Don't wait for life to get easy. Work on getting stronger. Resilience is the ability to bounce back, and you can train it."

**Script 3: Kick the Sh*t out of Option B**
*   **Audio:** "We all want Option A. The perfect career. The perfect health. The perfect relationship. But sometimes Option A is taken away. Sheryl Sandberg’s advice? 'Option A is not available. So let's just kick the sh*t out of Option B.' Stop mourning what could have been and start building what can be. Your second-best life can still be amazing."

**Script 4: It Could Be Worse**
*   **Audio:** "When Sheryl Sandberg lost her husband, she was devastated. But a friend told her: 'It could be worse. He could have had that heart attack while driving your children.' Suddenly, she felt a wave of gratitude that her kids were alive. Finding the 'worse' scenario isn't morbid; it’s a way to find light in the dark. Be grateful for what you still have."

**Script 5: Write it Down**
*   **Audio:** "Struggling with a trauma? Start journaling. But don't just write about your feelings. Write about what you DID. Every night, write down 3 things you handled well today. 'I made breakfast.' 'I answered a hard email.' 'I went for a walk.' Rebuilding your sense of competence is the key to rebuilding your life. One win at a time."
