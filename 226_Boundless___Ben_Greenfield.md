**Title:** How to Biohack Your Life (Ben Greenfield Summary)

**[0:00-2:00] The Boundless Life**
*   **Host:** "Ben Greenfield is the ultimate human guinea pig. He has tested every diet, every supplement, and every machine on Earth to find out what makes us perform at our peak. This is his 600-page bible of human performance: *Boundless*."

**[2:00-5:00] Brain Optimization**
*   **Host:** "Greenfield starts with the brain. If your head is foggy, your life is foggy. He suggests things like 'Neuro-feedback' and 'Nooptropics.' But his biggest tip? **Light**. You need red light in the morning and total darkness at night. Stop letting artificial blue light destroy your focus."

**[5:00-7:30] The Energy Secret: Mitochondria**
*   **Host:** "Your energy depends on your Mitochondria. Most people have 'weak' cells because they sit in cubicles all day. Greenfield says you need to 'shock' your system. Cold showers, morning sunlight, and 'ancestral' movement. If you want to feel 20 when you're 60, you have to keep your cells guessing."

**[7:30-9:00] The Spiritual Biohack**
*   **Host:** "The most surprising part of the book is the end. Greenfield says that all the cold baths and supplements don't matter if you are lonely or have no purpose. He argues that 'Gratitude' and 'Service' are the ultimate biohacks. They lower cortisol better than any pill."

**[9:00-10:00] Conclusion**
*   **Host:** "Optimization is a journey. Don't get overwhelmed. Start with the basics: sleep, sun, and sweat."

## 3. Short Form Video Scripts (30-60 Seconds)

**Script 1: The Morning Routine**
*   **Audio:** "Want to perform like a pro? Ben Greenfield’s morning routine takes 3 hours, but you only need 10 minutes. 1. Drink 20 ounces of water with sea salt and lemon. 2. Get 5 minutes of direct sunlight. 3. Do 5 minutes of breathwork. That’s it. You’ve just hydrated your cells, set your circadian rhythm, and calmed your nervous system. Win the morning, win the life."

**Script 2: Mitochondrial Health**
*   **Audio:** "Why are you always tired? It’s probably your mitochondria—the power plants in your cells. Modern life is making them weak. To fix them, you need 'hormetic stress.' That means short bursts of intense cold (cold shower), intense heat (sauna), or intense exercise. When you stress your cells, they grow back stronger. Stop being comfortable and start being energetic."

**Script 3: The Blue Light Problem**
*   **Audio:** "You are wearing digital sunglasses at night. Every screen you look at is telling your brain that it’s high noon. This stops the production of Melatonin, which prevents your brain from repairing itself while you sleep. Ben Greenfield’s fix? Wear blue-light blocking glasses after sunset. It’s the easiest way to double your deep sleep quality."

**Script 4: Eat Like Your Ancestors**
*   **Audio:** "Stop eating food that comes in a box. Ben Greenfield says we should eat 'Ancestrally.' Real meat, real vegetables, real fats. And most importantly, stop grazing all day! Give your gut a break with intermittent fasting. Your body isn't a dumpster; it’s a Ferrari. Fuel it with high-quality ingredients."

**Script 5: The Ultimate Biohack**
*   **Audio:** "What is the most powerful biohack in existence? It’s not a supplement. It’s not a machine. It’s Purpose. Research shows that people with a strong 'Why' live longer and have lower inflammation. Ben Greenfield says you can have the perfect diet, but if you don't have a reason to get out of bed, your health will suffer. Find your mission to find your health."
