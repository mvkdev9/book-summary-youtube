**Title:** How to Stay Rich During a Crash (Unshakeable Summary)

**[0:00-2:00] The Fear Factor**
*   **Host:** "The news tells you the market is going to crash. Your friends are panicking. You're tempted to sell everything. Tony Robbins says: 'STOP.' A crash is the best thing that can happen to you if you are prepared. Today we look at his survival guide: *Unshakeable*."

**[2:00-5:00] Corrections are Normal**
*   **Host:** "Tony gives us the data. On average, the market 'corrects' (drops 10%) every single year. A 'Bear Market' (drops 20% or more) happens every 3 to 5 years. If you know the weather report, you don't panic when it rains. You just grab an umbrella. Stop treating normal events like disasters."

**[5:00-7:30] Don't Pay the "Stupidity Tax"**
*   **Host:** "The biggest drain on your wealth isn't the market—it’s **Fees**. 96% of mutual funds fail to beat the market over time. Yet they charge you 10 times more than an index fund. Tony calls this the 'Stupidity Tax.' If you want to be unshakeable, you have to move your money to low-cost index funds today."

**[7:30-9:00] The Psychology of Wealth**
*   **Host:** "Wealth is 80% psychology and 20% mechanics. Most people lose money because they sell when things look scary. But the unshakeable investor knows that 'Winter' is when you plant the seeds for 'Spring.' You have to train your brain to love the bear market."

**[9:00-10:00] Conclusion**
*   **Host:** "Master your fear. Master your money. Stay unshakeable."

**Script 1: Corrections are Normal**
*   **Audio:** "Stop panicking every time the stock market drops. Market 'corrections'—a 10% dip—happen almost every year since 1900. It’s like the seasons. You don't sell your house because it snowed! Tony Robbins says the biggest mistake you can make is selling during a dip. Stay in the game and let time do the work for you."

**Script 2: Stocks on Sale**
*   **Audio:** "What do you do when your favorite store has a 30% off sale? You run there and buy everything! But when the stock market has a 30% off sale, people run away in fear. Tony Robbins says a 'Bear Market' is just a clearance sale on the world’s best companies. If you want to be rich, you have to buy when everyone else is selling."

**Script 3: The 96% Fail Rate**
*   **Audio:** "Do you have a 'Stock Picker' managing your money? Fire them. 96% of active fund managers fail to beat the market over long periods of time. You are paying them a huge fee to get worse results than a simple computer. Switch to low-cost Index Funds. You'll save thousands in fees and have more money in the end. Don't pay for failure."

**Script 4: Asymmetric Risk**
*   **Audio:** "The secret to the 1% is Asymmetric Risk. They look for deals where they can risk \$1 to make \$5. Most people do the opposite—they risk their whole life savings for a 5% return. Before you invest, ask: 'What is my downside?' If you can't survive the loss, don't take the bet. Protect your capital at all costs."

**Script 5: Unshakeable Mindset**
*   **Audio:** "Wealth isn't a number in your bank account; it's a state of mind. To be 'Unshakeable' means you have peace of mind when the world is in chaos. You know your plan is solid. You know the market will recover. And you know that your happiness doesn't depend on a ticker symbol. Build your character first, and the wealth will follow."
