# Find Your Why by Simon Sinek

## 1. Long Detailed Summary for Blog

**Title:** A Practical Guide for Discovering Purpose for You and Your Team: *Find Your Why*

**Introduction**
While *Start with Why* explained the theory, *Find Your Why* provides the step-by-step process. Sinek, along with David Mead and Peter Docker, shows individuals and organizations how to uncover their unique Why statement.

**The Process for Individuals**
1.  **Gather Stories:** Look back at your life. Identify 7-10 specific moments where you felt truly alive or fulfilled.
2.  **Share with a Partner:** You cannot find your Why alone. You need someone else to listen to your stories and identify the common threads.
3.  **Find the Golden Thread:** Look for the recurring themes. What was the contribution you made? What was the impact?
4.  **Draft Your Why Statement:** "To [Contribution] so that [Impact]."

**The Process for Tribes (Organizations)**
*   The Why of a company usually comes from the founder's stories.
*   Conduct a "Tribal Discovery" session to find the common purpose that binds the team together.

**Key Insights**
*   **The Friend Exercise:** Ask a friend "Why are we friends?" Keep asking until they describe how you make them feel. That feeling is a clue to your Why.
*   **The Why Statement must be actionable.**

**Conclusion**
Your Why is your compass. Once you find it, every decision becomes clear.

**Title:** How to Discover Your Purpose (Step-by-Step)

**[0:00-2:00] Theory vs Practice**
*   **Host:** "Last week we talked about *Start with Why*. But people kept asking: 'How do I actually find my Why?' Simon Sinek answered them with this book: *Find Your Why*. Today we are going to do the exercises together."

**[2:00-5:00] The Stories**
*   **Host:** "Step 1 is the Stories. Your Why is not in your future; it’s in your past. You have to go digging. Look for moments where you felt like 'I would do this for free.' These are your data points. You need about 10 of them."

**[5:00-7:30] The Partner**
*   **Host:** "This is the part everyone skips. You need a partner. Why? Because you are too close to your own life. You can't see the patterns. Your partner's job is to listen to your stories and look for the 'Golden Thread'—the thing that keeps coming up."

**[7:30-9:00] The Draft**
*   **Host:** "Now you write the statement. It follows a specific format: 'To [CONTRIBUTE] so that [IMPACT].' For example: 'To inspire people to do what inspires them so that, together, we can change our world.' It has to be simple and it has to be about others."

**[9:00-10:00] Conclusion**
*   **Host:** "Your Why is your superpower. Go find it."

## 3. Short Form Video Scripts (30-60 Seconds)

**Script 1: The Friend Exercise**
*   **Audio:** "Want a shortcut to your purpose? Try the 'Friend Exercise.' Ask a close friend: 'Why are we friends?' They’ll start with generic answers like 'You're nice.' Keep pushing. Ask 'What is it specifically about me that makes you like being with me?' Eventually, they'll get emotional. They'll describe the value you bring to their life. That is your WHY. Record their answer."

**Script 2: Past, not Future**
*   **Audio:** "Stop looking into the future to find your purpose. Your 'Why' is already there—it’s in your past. It was formed by the age of 20. Your job is to go back and look at your best memories. What was the common theme? Were you always the one organizing? The one listening? The one building? Dig into your history to find your destiny."

**Script 3: To... So That...**
*   **Audio:** "A good mission statement is simple. Simon Sinek uses the formula: 'To [Contribution] so that [Impact].' The first part is the action you take. The second part is the result you want to see in the world. If you can't put your life's purpose into that one sentence, you haven't found it yet. Simplicity is clarity."

**Script 4: You Need a Partner**
*   **Audio:** "You are the worst person to find your own 'Why.' Why? Because you're in the jar. You can't read the label from the inside. You need a partner to listen to your stories and tell you what they see. They will see the patterns that you think are 'just normal.' Your unique gift is obvious to everyone but you."

**Script 5: The Origin Story**
*   **Audio:** "If you own a business, your company's 'Why' is your 'Why.' It’s the reason you started the thing in the first place. Go back to day one. What was the problem you were trying to solve? What was the belief you had? Every successful company is just a scaled-up version of the founder's passion. Don't lose the origin story."
