# Brain Rules by John Medina

## 1. Long Detailed Summary for Blog

**Title:** 12 Principles for Surviving and Thriving at Work, Home, and School: *Brain Rules*

**Introduction**
Developmental molecular biologist John Medina distills what we know about how the brain works into 12 "Rules." He argues that our modern environments (offices and schools) are designed in ways that ignore these biological rules, leading to stress and inefficiency.

**The 12 Rules**
1.  **Exercise:** Exercise boosts brain power. It improves blood flow and increases BDNF.
2.  **Survival:** The human brain evolved to survive in a dangerous environment, not to sit in a cubicle.
3.  **Wiring:** Every brain is wired differently. No two people process information the same way.
4.  **Attention:** We don't pay attention to boring things. The brain can only focus for about 10 minutes before it needs a "hook."
5.  **Short-term Memory:** Repeat to remember.
6.  **Long-term Memory:** Remember to repeat. Space out your learning.
7.  **Sleep:** Sleep well, think well. A lack of sleep destroys creativity and focus.
8.  **Stress:** Stressed brains don't learn the same way. High cortisol levels kill brain cells.
9.  **Sensory Integration:** Stimulate more of the senses. We learn better when we see, hear, and smell.
10. **Vision:** Vision trumps all other senses. We are visual animals.
11. **Gender:** Male and female brains are different.
12. **Exploration:** We are powerful and natural explorers. Curiosity is our greatest tool.

**Conclusion**
If you want to be smarter, you have to follow the rules of your own biology.

**Title:** 12 Rules for a Better Brain (Medina Summary)

**[0:00-2:00] The Biological Mismatch**
*   **Host:** "Most of us work in an office or a school. But John Medina says these are the worst possible environments for your brain. Your brain was designed to solve problems while moving through the jungle. Today we look at the 12 laws of the head: *Brain Rules*."

**[2:00-5:00] Rule #1 & #4: Exercise and Attention**
*   **Host:** "Rule #1: **Exercise**. If you want to think better, you have to move. Our ancestors walked 12 miles a day. When you sit still, your brain thinks you're sleeping. Rule #4: **Attention**. You only have 10 minutes. If you are giving a speech or a class, you have to reset the clock every 10 minutes with a story or a joke. If it’s boring, the brain shuts down."

**[5:00-7:30] Rule #7 & #8: Sleep and Stress**
*   **Host:** "Rule #7: **Sleep**. If you lose a night of sleep, your IQ drops. You become a zombie. Rule #8: **Stress**. High stress (Cortisol) literally melts your brain cells. You cannot learn or be creative when you are terrified. If you want a productive team, you have to make them feel safe."

**[7:30-9:00] Rule #10: Vision**
*   **Host:** "**Vision** trumps everything. We remember 10% of what we hear, but 65% of what we see. If you want someone to remember your idea, use a picture, not a bullet point. Your brain is a movie screen, not a spreadsheet."

**[9:00-10:00] Conclusion**
*   **Host:** "Respect your biology. Move, sleep, and explore. Thanks for watching."

## 3. Short Form Video Scripts (30-60 Seconds)

**Script 1: Exercise for IQ**
*   **Audio:** "Want a promotion? Start walking. Dr. John Medina found that aerobic exercise is the #1 way to increase your brain power. It increases blood flow to the brain and triggers 'Miracle-Gro' for your neurons. If you're stuck on a problem, stop thinking and start moving. A 20-minute walk is better for your career than an extra hour at your desk."

**Script 2: The 10-Minute Rule**
*   **Audio:** "You only have 10 minutes of attention. After that, your brain needs a break. If you are giving a presentation, don't just drone on. Every 10 minutes, you need a 'Hook'—a story, a video, or a laugh. If you don't reset the clock, your audience will tune out. Respect the 10-minute limit and you'll be the most engaging person in the room."

**Script 3: Sleep is Thinking**
*   **Audio:** "Think you can skip sleep to get ahead? You're wrong. When you sleep, your brain isn't 'off.' It’s working! It’s filing your memories and cleaning out toxins. If you don't sleep, your brain becomes a cluttered mess. One night of bad sleep can cut your focus in half. If you want to be smart, go to bed. Sleep is the ultimate competitive advantage."

**Script 4: Stress Destroys Learning**
*   **Audio:** "You cannot learn while you are stressed. It’s biologically impossible. Stress releases Cortisol, which tells your brain to focus on 'Survival' instead of 'Logic.' High stress literally kills the cells in your hippocampus—the center of memory. If you want your kids or your employees to learn, you have to create an environment of safety. Fear is the enemy of intelligence."

**Script 5: Vision Trumps All**
*   **Audio:** "Stop using PowerPoint bullet points! No one remembers them. Humans are visual animals. We process pictures 60,000 times faster than text. If you want your message to stick, use an image. A simple diagram is worth more than 1000 words. If they can't see it, they won't remember it. Lead with the eyes."
