# Verbal Judo by George J. Thompson

## 1. Long Detailed Summary for Blog

**Title:** The Gentle Art of Persuasion: *Verbal Judo*

**Introduction**
George Thompson, a former police officer and English professor, teaches how to use words to redirect the energy of an attacker—just like physical judo. The goal is to stay professional, remain calm, and get compliance without using force.

**The Principles of Verbal Judo**
1.  **Presence:** Looking and sounding like you are in control.
2.  **Empathy:** Understanding the other person’s perspective (even if you disagree).
3.  **The Tactical 5-Step Pattern:**
    *   *Ask:* State the request.
    *   *Set the Context:* Explain why.
    *   *Present Options:* Give them a choice.
    *   *Confirm:* Is there anything I can say?
    *   *Act:* If they still refuse, take necessary action.
4.  **RESPECT:** (Acknowledge, Empathize, Support, Power, Expect, Control, Trust).
5.  **Mushin:** The "Mind like Water." Not taking insults personally.

**Key Insight**
"When you react, the other person is in control. When you respond, you are in control."

**Conclusion**
Verbal Judo is for anyone who has to deal with difficult people. It allows you to win the war of words without firing a shot.

**Title:** How to Deflect Insults Like a Pro (Verbal Judo Summary)

**[0:00-2:00] The Power of Words**
*   **Host:** "Dr. George Thompson was a black belt in Karate and a PhD in English. He combined them to create **Verbal Judo**. He taught police officers how to de-escalate situations with nothing but their voice. Today we learn how to use these tactics in your life and your job."

**[2:00-5:00] Respond vs React**
*   **Host:** "When someone yells at you, your instinct is to yell back. That is **Reacting**. When you react, the other person is the puppet master—they are pulling your strings. Verbal Judo is about **Responding**. You stay professional. You use their energy to trip them up. You stay in the driver's seat."

**[5:00-7:30] The Tactical 5-Step**
*   **Host:** "How do you get someone to do what you want? Use the 5-step pattern. 1. Ask nicely. 2. Explain the rules. 3. Give them options. 4. Give them one last chance to do the right thing. 5. If they fail, you act. Most people jump straight to Step 5. That’s why they have so much drama."

**[7:30-9:00] Empathy is a Tool**
*   **Host:** "Thompson says: 'Empathy is the most powerful word in the English language.' It doesn't mean being nice. It means understanding the enemy. If you know what they want, you can manipulate the situation to get what YOU want. It’s tactical, not emotional."

**[9:00-10:00] Conclusion**
*   **Host:** "Stay calm. Stay professional. Use Verbal Judo."

**Script 1: Respond, don't React**
*   **Audio:** "Here is the golden rule of Verbal Judo: 'When you react, the other person is in control. When you respond, YOU are in control.' If someone insults you and you get mad, they won. They dictated your mood. But if you stay professional and keep your eyes on the goal, you win. Don't be a puppet. Be the master of your own words."

**Script 2: The Empathy Tool**
*   **Audio:** "Empathy isn't about 'feeling' for someone. It’s about 'understanding' them. George Thompson says empathy is a tactical weapon. If you can see the world through your opponent's eyes, you can see their weaknesses. You can see what will make them say yes. Stop trying to be right, and start trying to be effective. Use empathy to win."

**Script 3: Mushin**
*   **Audio:** "In Judo, there is a concept called 'Mushin'—the Mind like Water. Imagine a lake. If you throw a rock in, the water responds, then returns to calm. It doesn't get 'angry' at the rock. You should be the same. When someone attacks you verbally, let the words pass through you. Don't let them sink your ship. Stay still, stay calm, stay powerful."

**Script 4: The 5-Step Pattern**
*   **Audio:** "Want to get compliance? Use the 5 steps. 1. Ask. 2. Explain why. 3. Give them two options. 4. Ask 'Is there anything I can say to make you cooperate?' 5. Take action. By the time you get to step 5, they know it’s their choice, not your fault. It removes the ego from the conflict. Be systematic, not emotional."

**Script 5: Stay Professional**
*   **Audio:** "You don't have to like the people you work with. You just have to be professional. Verbal Judo teaches that your 'Personal Face' is for your family, but your 'Professional Face' is for the world. If you let people see your personal face, they can hurt you. Put on the mask of professionalism and stay untouchable."
