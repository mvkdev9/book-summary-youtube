**Script 1: The Big Snooze**
*   **Audio:** "Your ego is the 'Big Snooze.' It wants you to stay safe, small, and bored. It tells you 'You can't do that' or 'Who do you think you are?' Wake up. That voice is a liar. You are powerful beyond measure. Tell the Big Snooze to go back to sleep."

**Script 2: Money is Energy**
*   **Audio:** "If you think money is 'the root of all evil,' you will never have any. Why would you attract something you hate? Jen Sincero says money is just energy. It’s a tool. It allows you to help people and live freely. Make peace with money. It wants to be your friend."

**Script 3: Frequency**
*   **Audio:** "The universe is like a radio. If you are broadcasting on the 'I'm a loser' frequency, you will hear sad songs. If you broadcast on the 'I am a badass' frequency, you will hear victory songs. Change your frequency by changing your thoughts. Like attracts like."

**Script 4: Excuses**
*   **Audio:** "Jen Sincero has a quote for you: 'If you are serious about changing your life, you'll find a way. If you're not, you'll find an excuse.' Which one are you finding today? The way? Or the excuse? Be honest."

*   **Audio:** "Holding onto guilt is like holding onto a hot coal. It burns you. Forgive yourself for your past mistakes. You did the best you could with what you knew. Now you know better. Let it go. Your future needs you, not your past."
