**Title:** How to Retire Early (The Simple Path to Wealth)

**[0:00-2:00] The Lie**
*   **Host:** "Wall Street wants you to think investing is like brain surgery. They want you to hire a 'Financial Advisor' who charges you 1% of your wealth every year. But J.L. Collins says that is a scam. You can outperform 90% of pros by doing absolutely nothing. This is *The Simple Path to Wealth*."

**[2:00-5:00] F-You Money**
*   **Host:** "What is the point of money? It’s not for cars or houses. It’s for **Freedom**. Collins calls it 'F-You Money.' It’s the amount of money where you can look at your boss and say 'I'm out.' When you have this, your stress disappears. Your life becomes your own. But you can't have freedom if you have debt. Step 1: Kill the debt. All of it."

**[5:00-7:30] VTSAX: The Only Fund You Need**
*   **Host:** "Stop trying to pick the next Apple or Tesla. You'll probably fail. Instead, buy everything. Collins suggests the **Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund (VTSAX)**. It owns every major company in America. When the economy grows, you grow. It’s cheap, it’s safe, and it has built more millionaires than any other strategy."

**[7:30-9:00] The 4% Rule**
*   **Host:** "How much is 'enough'? Use the 4% rule. If you spend \$40,000 a year, you need \$1 million in the bank. Once you reach that number, you can take out 4% every year forever and never run out of money. You are officially retired. You don't need a job; you have an engine."

**[9:00-10:00] Conclusion**
*   **Host:** "Invest early. Stay the course. Don't panic. The path is simple."

## 3. Short Form Video Scripts (30-60 Seconds)

**Script 1: Stop Picking Stocks**
*   **Audio:** "You are not smarter than the market. Even the pros at Goldman Sachs can't consistently beat the index. So why are you trying? J.L. Collins’ advice is simple: Stop picking stocks and start buying the whole market. Buy a Total Stock Market Index Fund like VTSAX. It’s low-cost, low-risk, and guaranteed to win in the long run. Stop gambling and start investing."

**Script 2: F-You Money**
*   **Audio:** "The best thing money can buy is your freedom. J.L. Collins calls it 'F-You Money.' It’s that pile of cash that allows you to say 'No' to a toxic boss or a soul-crushing job. Most people spend their lives one paycheck away from disaster. Build your F-You fund today so you never have to do something you hate just to pay the bills."

**Script 3: The 4% Rule**
*   **Audio:** "How do you know when you can quit your job? Use the 4% Rule. Take your annual expenses and multiply them by 25. If you spend \$50,000 a year, you need \$1.25 million. Once you have that in a low-cost index fund, you can live off the growth forever. You don't need a pension; you need a portfolio. Calculate your number today."

**Script 4: Debt is a Disease**
*   **Audio:** "If you have credit card debt, you aren't an investor; you're a victim. You are paying 20% interest while the stock market only pays 10%. You are literally moving backward. Before you buy a single share of stock, kill the debt. Every dollar you pay toward debt is a guaranteed 20% return on your investment. Clean the slate before you build the empire."

**Script 5: Stay the Course**
*   **Audio:** "The market will crash. It’s a fact. And when it does, the news will tell you to sell. Don't! J.L. Collins says the only way to lose money in index funds is to sell when it's down. If you stay the course and keep buying, the market always recovers. Wealth is a test of temperament, not intelligence. Be the one who stays calm when everyone else panics."
