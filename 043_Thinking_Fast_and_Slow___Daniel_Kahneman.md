# Thinking, Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman

## 1. Long Detailed Summary for Blog

**Title:** How Your Brain Tricks You: *Thinking, Fast and Slow*

**Introduction**
Nobel Prize winner Daniel Kahneman explains the two systems that drive the way we think.
*   **System 1:** Fast, intuitive, emotional, automatic. (e.g., 2+2, Driving on an empty road).
*   **System 2:** Slow, deliberative, logical, effortful. (e.g., 17 x 24, Parking in a tight spot).

**The Problem**
System 1 is the hero and the villain. It saves us time, but it is prone to bias. System 2 is lazy and often just agrees with System 1.

**Key Biases**
1.  **Anchoring:** We rely too heavily on the first piece of information (the price tag).
2.  **Availability Heuristic:** We think things are more common if we can easily remember examples (e.g., fearing plane crashes more than car crashes).
3.  **Loss Aversion:** We hate losing \$100 more than we like winning \$100.
4.  **Sunk Cost Fallacy:** Throwing good money after bad.

**Conclusion**
We are not rational actors. We are irrational, but in predictable ways.

**Title:** You Are Not Rational (The Two Systems of Thinking)

**[0:00-2:00] The Bat and Ball**
*   **Host:** "A bat and a ball cost \$1.10. The bat costs \$1.00 more than the ball. How much does the ball cost?"
*   **Host:** "Your brain screamed: 10 cents! But that's wrong. If the ball is 10c, the bat is \$1.10. Total \$1.20. The answer is 5 cents."
*   **Host:** "That was System 1 thinking. Fast. Intuitive. And wrong. Welcome to *Thinking, Fast and Slow*."

**[2:00-5:00] System 1 vs. System 2**
*   **Host:** "System 1 is your autopilot. It detects anger in a face. It answers 2+2. It is fast and cheap."
*   **Host:** "System 2 is your conscious mind. It does logic. It is slow and expensive (burns energy). The problem is, System 2 is lazy. It lets System 1 run the show."

**[5:00-8:00] The Biases**
*   **Host:** "Because System 1 runs the show, we fall for biases."
*   **Anchoring:** "If I show you a \$5000 watch, then a \$200 watch, the second one looks cheap. That's an anchor."
*   **Loss Aversion:** "The pain of losing is twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. That's why we hold onto bad stocks."

**[8:00-10:00] Conclusion**
*   **Host:** "You can't turn off System 1. But you can learn to recognize when it's tricking you. Slow down. Call in System 2."

## 3. Short Form Video Scripts (30-60 Seconds)

**Script 1: System 1 vs System 2**
*   **Audio:** "You have two brains. System 1 is fast, emotional, and automatic. It answers 2+2 instantly. System 2 is slow, logical, and lazy. It answers 17 x 24. The problem? System 1 makes 98% of your decisions, and it makes mistakes. It’s full of bias. Learn to turn on System 2 when it matters."

**Script 2: Loss Aversion**
*   **Audio:** "Would you flip a coin? Heads you win \$100. Tails you lose \$100. Most people say no. Why? Because losing \$100 hurts more than winning \$100 feels good. This is 'Loss Aversion.' We play not to lose, rather than playing to win. Don't let fear dictate your math."

**Script 3: The Sunk Cost Fallacy**
*   **Audio:** "You sit through a terrible movie because you paid for the ticket. That is the Sunk Cost Fallacy. The money is gone. Sitting there won't get it back. All you are doing is spending your time *and* your money. Leave the movie. Quit the bad job. Sell the bad stock. Don't throw good life after bad money."

**Script 4: Anchoring**
*   **Audio:** "How much is this car? The sticker says \$30,000. The dealer offers it for \$25,000. You think it's a steal. Why? Because of the Anchor. The first number you see sets the expectation. If the sticker said \$20,000, you'd think \$25,000 was a rip-off. Beware the first number."

**Script 5: WYSIATI**
*   **Audio:** "Kahneman has an acronym: WYSIATI. What You See Is All There Is. System 1 only looks at the information right in front of it. It ignores what it doesn't know. This makes us overconfident. We tell stories based on 5% of the data. Always ask: 'What am I missing?'"
