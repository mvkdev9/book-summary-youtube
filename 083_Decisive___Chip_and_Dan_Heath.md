## 1. Long Detailed Summary for Blog

**Title:** How to Make Better Choices in Life and Work: *Decisive*

**Introduction**
We are bad at making decisions. We suffer from "narrow framing," "confirmation bias," and "short-term emotion." Chip and Dan Heath provide a 4-step framework to overcome these biases and make smarter choices.

**The WRAP Framework**
1.  **Widen Your Options:** Stop asking "Whether or not" (e.g., Should I quit my job?). Start asking "What else could I do?" (e.g., Can I work part-time? Can I change departments?). Look for "And" instead of "Or."
2.  **Reality-Test Your Assumptions:** Don't just look for info that supports your choice. Look for info that disproves it. "Oozing" (trying before you buy) is the best way to test.
3.  **Attain Distance Before Deciding:** Short-term emotions (fear, lust, anger) cloud judgment. Use the **10-10-10 Rule**: How will I feel about this in 10 minutes? 10 months? 10 years?
4.  **Prepare to be Wrong:** We are overconfident about the future. Use "Bookending"—predict the best-case and worst-case scenarios. Set a "Tripwire" to alert you when things are going off-track.

**Key Insights**
*   **Narrow Framing:** We often get stuck in a "binary" choice (A or B). Always look for Option C.
*   **Multitracking:** Working on two projects at once is often better than one, because it prevents you from getting too attached to a single idea.

**Conclusion**
A good decision-making process leads to better outcomes over time. Don't trust your gut; trust your process.

**Title:** How to Stop Making Bad Decisions (The WRAP Process)

**[0:00-2:00] The 4 Villains of Decisions**
*   **Host:** "Why do we make so many bad choices? Chip and Dan Heath say there are 4 villains: Narrow Framing (seeing only two choices), Confirmation Bias (only looking for data that agrees with us), Short-Term Emotion, and Overconfidence. Today we beat the villains with the WRAP process."

**[2:00-4:00] W - Widen Your Options**
*   **Host:** "Step 1 is Widen. Most people ask 'Should I do this or not?' That’s a trap. Ask: 'What else could I do with this time and money?' If you find yourself in a binary choice, push for a third option. Can you do both? Can you do neither?"

**[4:00-6:00] R - Reality-Test Your Assumptions**
*   **Host:** "Step 2 is Reality-Test. Don't just trust your gut. 'Ooze' into the decision. If you want to be a lawyer, don't just go to law school. Go work in a law firm for two weeks for free. See the reality before you commit."

**[6:00-8:00] A - Attain Distance**
*   **Host:** "Step 3 is Distance. Emotions are the enemy of logic. Use the 10-10-10 Rule. How will you feel about this decision in 10 minutes? 10 months? 10 years? This pulls you out of the 'heat of the moment' and gives you perspective."

**[8:00-9:00] P - Prepare to be Wrong**
*   **Host:** "Finally, Prepare to be Wrong. Assume your choice will fail. What happened? This is a 'Pre-Mortem.' Also, set a 'Tripwire.' If my business doesn't make \$1000 in 3 months, I will quit. It protects you from the sunk cost fallacy."

**[9:00-10:00] Conclusion**
*   **Host:** "Decide with your brain, not just your gut. Use WRAP."

## 3. Short Form Video Scripts (30-60 Seconds)

**Script 1: The 10-10-10 Rule**
*   **Audio:** "About to make a decision out of anger or fear? Stop. Use the 10-10-10 Rule. Ask yourself: 'How will I feel about this in 10 minutes? 10 months? And 10 years?' Most of the time, the thing that feels like a crisis today won't even matter in 10 months. Use time travel to get perspective and avoid decisions you'll regret."

**Script 2: Widen the Frame**
*   **Audio:** "Are you stuck between two choices? 'Should I stay or should I go?' 'Should I buy this or that?' You are suffering from Narrow Framing. Stop asking 'Whether or not' and start asking 'How else could I solve this problem?' Always look for a third option. When you widen the frame, you find better solutions that were hidden in plain sight."

**Script 3: Ooze into It**
*   **Audio:** "Stop making giant leaps. Start 'Oozing.' If you want to change careers, don't quit your job tomorrow. Take a class. Do an internship. Freelance on the weekends. Reality-test your assumptions before you spend your life savings. Small experiments save you from big mistakes. Try before you buy."

**Script 4: The Pre-Mortem**
*   **Audio:** "Before you start a new project, do a Pre-Mortem. Imagine it’s one year from now and the project has failed miserably. Now, ask: 'What happened?' This simple exercise forces you to see the risks you're currently ignoring. Identifying the obstacles before you start is the best way to prevent the crash."

**Script 5: The Tripwire**
*   **Audio:** "The hardest part of a bad decision is knowing when to quit. We fall for the Sunk Cost Fallacy. To avoid this, set a Tripwire. Tell yourself: 'If I don't see X result by Y date, I am done.' It’s a signal to your future self to stop and re-evaluate. Don't let a bad choice become a lifelong burden."
