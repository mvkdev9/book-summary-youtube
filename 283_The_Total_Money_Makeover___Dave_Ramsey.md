**Title:** How to Get Out of Debt (The Dave Ramsey Method)

**[0:00-2:00] The Debt Trap**
*   **Host:** "The average American has \$6,000 in credit card debt and \$30,000 in student loans. We are drowning in payments! Dave Ramsey says: 'Enough.' You need a total money makeover. Today we look at his 7-step plan to financial freedom."

**[2:00-5:00] Step 1 & 2: The Snowball**
*   **Host:** "Step 1 is a \$1,000 emergency fund. This is just to stop you from using your credit cards when your tire blows out. Step 2 is the **Debt Snowball**. List your debts: \$500 medical bill, \$2000 credit card, \$10,000 car. Pay off the medical bill first. Why? Because you need a WIN. Math says pay the high interest first, but psychology says pay the small one first. Once you see a debt disappear, you'll be fired up to kill the next one."

**[5:00-7:30] Gazelle Intensity**
*   **Host:** "To get out of debt, you have to be 'Gazelle Intense.' That means no eating out. No vacations. No new clothes. You sell everything that isn't nailed down. You work two jobs. You run like your life depends on it—because it does. You have to hate your debt more than you love your comfort."

**[7:30-9:00] Live Like No One Else**
*   **Host:** "Dave’s motto is: 'Live like no one else, so later you can LIVE like no one else.' While your friends are buying new trucks on 7-year loans, you are saving and investing. In 10 years, they will still have payments, and you will have a paid-off house and a million dollars. Who's the smart one now?"

**[9:00-10:00] Conclusion**
*   **Host:** "Cut up the cards. Start the snowball. Get your freedom back."

## 3. Short Form Video Scripts (30-60 Seconds)

**Script 1: The Debt Snowball**
*   **Audio:** "Want to pay off your debt? Stop looking at the interest rates. Dave Ramsey found that success in money is 80% behavior. List your debts from smallest to largest. Pay off the tiny one first. The 'Win' gives you dopamine. It proves you can do it. Then take that payment and add it to the next one. This is the Debt Snowball. It builds momentum until your debt is crushed. Start small to win big."

**Script 2: \$1,000 Emergency Fund**
*   **Audio:** "You are one car repair away from a disaster. That’s why you're stressed! Step 1 of the Total Money Makeover is a \$1,000 starter emergency fund. Sell your old clothes, work an extra shift, do whatever it takes to get that \$1,000 in the bank this week. It’s not an investment; it’s an insurance policy against your own life. Get your umbrella before it starts raining."

**Script 3: Cash is Painful**
*   **Audio:** "Why do you spend so much? Because your credit card doesn't hurt. Research shows that the brain's 'Pain Centers' light up when you spend cash, but they stay dark when you swipe a card. Dave Ramsey suggests the 'Envelope System.' Put your grocery money in a physical envelope. When it's empty, you stop eating. If you want to control your spending, you have to feel the friction."

**Script 4: Live Like No One Else**
*   **Audio:** "Your friends are broke. They have nice cars and big houses, but they have zero in the bank. Why are you trying to copy them? Dave Ramsey says: 'Live like no one else now, so you can live like no one else later.' Be the weird one who brings lunch from home. Be the one who drives the 10-year-old car. Sacrifice your 'Image' today to secure your 'Wealth' tomorrow."

**Script 5: The Borrower is Slave**
*   **Audio:** "The Bible says: 'The borrower is slave to the lender.' Every time you take a loan, you are giving a piece of your future to a bank. You are working for them, not for yourself. Imagine what your life would look like if you had zero payments. No car payment, no student loan, no mortgage. That is true freedom. Stop being a slave and start being an owner."
