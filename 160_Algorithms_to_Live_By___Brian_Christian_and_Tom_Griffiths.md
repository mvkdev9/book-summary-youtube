# Algorithms to Live By by Brian Christian and Tom Griffiths

**Title:** The Computer Science of Human Decisions: *Algorithms to Live By*

**Introduction**
Brian Christian and Tom Griffiths argue that computer science isn't just for computers. The algorithms designed to solve complex data problems can also be used to solve human problems—like choosing a house, organizing a closet, or managing time.

**Key Insights**
1.  **Optimal Stopping (The 37% Rule):** If you are looking at 100 houses, you should look at the first 37 and reject them all. Then, buy the next one that is better than all the previous ones. This gives you the best statistical chance of success.
2.  **Explore/Exploit:** When should you try a new restaurant (Explore) and when should you go to your favorite (Exploit)? If you are moving tomorrow, exploit. If you are staying for 10 years, explore.
3.  **Sorting vs. Searching:** We spend too much time sorting things (like emails) when searching is actually more efficient. Don't file it; just search for it later.
4.  **Caching:** Keep the things you use most often in the most accessible place. (e.g., The "Pile" of clothes on the chair is actually an efficient cache!).
5.  **Relaxation:** When a problem is too hard to solve perfectly, "relax" the constraints. Aim for "good enough."

**Conclusion**
Computers and humans face the same constraints: limited time, space, and information. We can use their logic to live better.

**Title:** How to Use Computer Science to Fix Your Life

**[0:00-2:00] The 37% Rule**
*   **Host:** "How many people should you date before you get married? How many apartments should you look at? Computer science has an exact answer: 37%. It’s called 'Optimal Stopping.' Today we look at Brian Christian’s *Algorithms to Live By*."

**[2:00-5:00] Explore vs Exploit**
*   **Host:** "Every Friday, you have a choice. Do you go to your favorite pizza place, or try that new Thai place? This is the **Explore/Exploit** tradeoff. If you're young, you should Explore. You need data! If you're old, you should Exploit. You don't have enough time left to risk a bad meal. Use your time wisely."

**[5:00-7:30] Sorting is a Waste of Time**
*   **Host:** "Do you spend an hour every day filing your emails into folders? Stop it. Computer science proves that 'Sorting' takes more time than 'Searching.' It’s faster to leave everything in one big pile and use the search bar when you need it. Embrace the mess."

**[7:30-9:00] Time Management (Scheduling)**
*   **Host:** "How do computers handle 1000 tasks at once? They don't. They do one at a time. They use 'Interrupt Coalescing'—grouping all their interruptions together so they can do deep work in between. Don't check your phone every 5 minutes. Check it once an hour. Batch your distractions."

**[9:00-10:00] Conclusion**
*   **Host:** "You are an algorithm. Optimize your life."

## 3. Short Form Video Scripts (30-60 Seconds)

**Script 1: The 37% Rule**
*   **Audio:** "Looking for a new house? Or a life partner? Use the 37% rule. If you plan to look at 10 options, spend the first 37% just looking—no buying! Reject them all. Then, pick the very next option that is better than everything you saw in the first 37%. Statistically, this is the best way to find the 'one.' Don't settle too early, and don't look forever."

**Script 2: Explore vs Exploit**
*   **Audio:** "Should you try something new or stick to what you know? It depends on your 'Time Horizon.' If you're staying in a city for a year, Explore! Try every cafe. If you're leaving tomorrow, Exploit! Go to your favorite spot. Use your 'Future Time' to justify your 'Present Risks.' Knowledge is only valuable if you have time to use it."

**Script 3: Stop Filing Emails**
*   **Audio:** "You are wasting your life filing emails. Computer scientists have found that 'Sorting' is mathematically more expensive than 'Searching.' It takes 10 times longer to put an email in a folder than it does to just type a keyword into the search bar later. Delete your folders. Save your time for the work that actually matters."

**Script 4: The Power of Piles**
*   **Audio:** "Is your desk covered in piles of paper? Good! That’s actually a 'Least Recently Used' Cache. The stuff on top is what you use most often. The stuff on bottom is what you can probably throw away. Piles are an efficient self-organizing system. Don't let the 'clean desk' people shame you. Your mess is an algorithm."

**Script 5: Good Enough is Perfect**
*   **Audio:** "Some problems are 'NP-Hard'—meaning they are mathematically impossible to solve perfectly in a human lifetime. Like the 'Traveling Salesman' problem or your 'Weekly Schedule.' Stop trying to find the perfect solution. Computers don't! They use 'Heuristics'—smart shortcuts that get them to 99% of the way there. Aim for 'Good Enough' and get back to living."
