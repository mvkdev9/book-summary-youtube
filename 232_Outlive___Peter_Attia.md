# Outlive by Peter Attia

## 1. Long Detailed Summary for Blog

**Title:** The Science and Art of Longevity: *Outlive*

**Introduction**
Dr. Peter Attia argues that modern medicine (Medicine 2.0) is great at treating acute problems (broken bones, infections) but terrible at treating chronic diseases. He proposes **Medicine 3.0**, which focuses on prevention and "Lifespan" (how long you live) plus "Healthspan" (the quality of those years).

**Key Insights**
1.  **The Four Horsemen:** Most people die from one of four things: Cancer, Cardiovascular disease, Type 2 diabetes, or Neurodegenerative disease (Alzheimer’s). You must start fighting these in your 30s and 40s.
2.  **Exercise is the Most Powerful Drug:** Better than any pill or diet. You need a mix of:
    *   *Zone 2 Training:* Low-intensity cardio for metabolic health.
    *   *VO2 Max:* High-intensity for longevity.
    *   *Strength:* Essential for avoiding falls and frailty in old age.
3.  **Metabolic Health:** Insulin resistance is the "gateway" to the other three horsemen. Monitor your blood sugar and ApoB levels.
4.  **Emotional Health:** There is no point in living to 100 if you are miserable. Attia shares his own struggle with mental health.

**Conclusion**
Longevity is a proactive sport. You have to train for your "Marginal Decade"—the last 10 years of your life—today.

**Title:** How to Live Longer and Better (Peter Attia Summary)

**[0:00-2:00] Medicine 3.0**
*   **Host:** "Traditional medicine waits until you are sick to treat you. Dr. Peter Attia says that is too late. If you want to live to 100 and still be able to pick up your grandkids, you need **Medicine 3.0**. You have to be the CEO of your own health. This is *Outlive*."

**[2:00-5:00] The Four Horsemen**
*   **Host:** "Attia identifies the 'Four Horsemen' that kill 80% of us: Heart disease, Cancer, Alzheimer’s, and Diabetes. These don't happen overnight. They start decades before you have symptoms. The goal of *Outlive* is to find the 'Early Warning Signs'—like high ApoB or insulin resistance—and crush them now."

**[5:00-7:30] The Training Plan**
*   **Host:** "Attia says **Exercise** is the ultimate longevity tool. He suggests a specific plan. 1. **Zone 2 Cardio** (4 hours a week)—walking fast enough that you can still talk but it's hard. 2. **Strength Training**—muscle mass is the best predictor of survival as you age. 3. **VO2 Max**—pushing your heart to its limit once a week. If you don't use it, you lose it."

**[7:30-9:00] The Centenarian Decathlon**
*   **Host:** "Ask yourself: What do I want to be able to do when I'm 90? Carry a bag of groceries? Walk up stairs? Get off the floor? Attia calls this the **Centenarian Decathlon**. To do those things at 90, you have to be an athlete at 50. You are training for the most important race of your life: your last decade."

**[9:00-10:00] Conclusion**
*   **Host:** "Don't just add years to your life. Add life to your years."

## 3. Short Form Video Scripts (30-60 Seconds)

**Script 1: Medicine 3.0**
*   **Audio:** "Your doctor is playing defense. They wait for you to get a disease and then they try to fix it. Peter Attia calls this Medicine 2.0. If you want to truly live long, you need Medicine 3.0. That means playing offense. You have to look for the 'Four Horsemen'—heart disease, cancer, and diabetes—decades before they show up. Be the architect of your own longevity."

**Script 2: Zone 2 Training**
*   **Audio:** "What is the best exercise for a long life? It’s not a sprint. It’s Zone 2. That’s low-intensity cardio where you can still have a conversation, but you're breathing heavy. Zone 2 trains your mitochondria to be efficient. It’s the foundation of metabolic health. Aim for 3 to 4 hours a week. It’s boring, but it’s the most powerful medicine we have."

**Script 3: The Centenarian Decathlon**
*   **Audio:** "Imagine you are 90 years old. What 10 physical tasks do you want to be able to do? Carry a 10-pound bag? Get out of a chair without help? Walk a mile? Dr. Peter Attia calls this the Centenarian Decathlon. To do those things at 90, you have to be 50% stronger at 50. You are training today for the person you will be in 40 years. Don't let your future self down."

**Script 4: Muscle is Insurance**
*   **Audio:** "As you get older, the most dangerous thing you can do is fall. And the reason people fall is because they lose muscle. Muscle isn't just for looks; it’s biological insurance. It protects your bones, it manages your blood sugar, and it keeps you mobile. Stop worrying about being 'bulky' and start lifting heavy things. Your 80-year-old self will thank you."

**Script 5: Healthspan vs Lifespan**
*   **Audio:** "What is the point of living to 100 if you spend the last 20 years in a hospital bed? That is the difference between Lifespan and Healthspan. Lifespan is how long you breathe. Healthspan is how well you live. Most people’s healthspan ends 10 years before they die. The goal of *Outlive* is to make those two numbers the same. Live well until the very end."
