**Title:** The Art of Letting Go (Daily Practices)

**[0:00-2:00] The Daily Struggle**
*   **Host:** "Recovering from a toxic relationship isn't easy. You have good days and bad days. Melody Beattie says you need a 'Language of Letting Go.' You have to talk to yourself differently every single day."

**[2:00-5:00] Surrender**
*   **Host:** "We spend our lives trying to 'Manage' the people around us. We think if we just say the right thing, they’ll stop drinking or start working. Surrender means admitting: 'I am powerless over them.' It sounds scary, but it’s the only way to find peace. You surrender your control to get your life back."

**[5:00-7:30] Trusting the Process**
*   **Host:** "Life is messy. Beattie says we have to trust that everything is happening for a reason. Even the pain. Even the loss. When you stop fighting the current of your life, you stop being exhausted. You start flowing."

**[7:30-9:00] Owning Your Truth**
*   **Host:** "Codependents are liars—they lie about how they feel to keep others happy. Letting go means being honest. 'I am angry.' 'I am sad.' 'I need a break.' When you speak your truth, you stop being a victim."

**[9:00-10:00] Conclusion**
*   **Host:** "Let go of the past. Let go of the people you can't change. Just be you."

**Script 1: Letting Go**
*   **Audio:** "What are you holding onto today? A grudge? A regret? A person who doesn't want to be changed? Melody Beattie says: 'Let it go.' Letting go doesn't mean you stop caring; it means you stop controlling. It means you stop being the manager of the universe and start being the manager of yourself. Breathe out and release the weight."

**Script 2: One Day at a Time**
*   **Audio:** "You can't solve your whole life today. It’s too big! Just focus on the next 24 hours. Be present. Be honest. Be kind. Recovery is a marathon made of single steps. If you try to look at the finish line, you'll trip over the rock right in front of you. Just handle today. Today is enough."

**Script 3: Feelings are Signals**
*   **Audio:** "Stop numbing your feelings. Whether it's with food, work, or social media—you are running from the very things that can heal you. Your feelings are signals. Anger tells you where you need a boundary. Sadness tells you what you’ve lost. Fear tells you what you value. Listen to the message, and the feeling will pass."

**Script 4: Trust the Flow**
*   **Audio:** "Do you feel like you're swimming upstream? Maybe it’s because you're fighting the flow of your life. Surrender isn't giving up; it’s choosing to flow with reality instead of against it. Trust that you are exactly where you need to be to learn the lesson you need to learn. Relax. The universe has got you."

**Script 5: Acceptance**
*   **Audio:** "Acceptance is the magic key. It doesn't mean you like the situation. It just means you stop pretending it isn't happening. 'I am in debt.' 'My partner is gone.' 'I am tired.' The moment you accept the truth, you gain the power to change it. Denial is a prison. Acceptance is the door."
