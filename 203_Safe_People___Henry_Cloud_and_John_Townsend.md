2.  **Responsibility:** They own their mistakes.
3.  **Honesty:** They speak the truth in love.
4.  **Grace:** They allow you to be human and imperfect.
5.  **Growth:** They are actively working on themselves.

**Title:** How to Spot a Toxic Person (Safe vs Unsafe)

**[0:00-2:00] The Vampire Friend**
*   **Host:** "We all have that one person in our life who is 'Unsafe.' You feel exhausted after talking to them. You feel like you're walking on eggshells. Why do we keep these people around? Today we learn how to identify them, with *Safe People*."

**[2:00-5:00] The 3 Categories of Unsafe**
*   **Host:** "Unsafe people usually fall into 3 categories. 1. **The Abandoners**—they are only there when things are good. 2. **The Critics**—they judge your every move. 3. **The Irresponsibles**—they never take the blame for anything. If you recognize these patterns, you need to set a boundary."

**[5:00-7:30] Traits of a Safe Person**
*   **Host:** "What does a safe person look like? They have **Grace**—they let you make mistakes. They have **Truth**—they tell you when you're wrong, but with kindness. And they have **Time**—they are consistent. A safe person is a 'home' for your soul. They make you feel energized, not drained."

**[7:30-9:00] Why We Attract Unsafe People**
*   **Host:** "If your life is full of toxic people, you have to look in the mirror. We attract what we are used to. If you grew up with critical parents, you'll look for critical friends. You have to heal your own 'Internal Safety' before you can find external safety."

**[9:00-10:00] Conclusion**
*   **Host:** "Audit your circle. Your life depends on it."

## 3. Short Form Video Scripts (30-60 Seconds)

**Script 1: Safe vs Unsafe**
*   **Audio:** "How do you know if someone is good for you? Use the Energy Test. After you hang out with them, do you feel more alive, or do you feel like you need a nap? Safe people are energy-givers. They listen, they support, and they own their sh*t. Unsafe people are energy-vampires. They drain you with their drama and their criticism. Protect your battery. Choose safe people."

**Script 2: The "No" Test**
*   **Audio:** "Want to spot a toxic person instantly? Tell them 'No.' A safe person will respect your limit and move on. An unsafe person will get angry, try to guilt-trip you, or ask 'Why?'. People who can't handle your 'No' are the ones who were benefiting from you not having one. Use your boundaries as a filter."

**Script 3: Honesty is Safety**
*   **Audio:** "A safe person is someone who can tell you the truth even when it’s uncomfortable. If someone always agrees with you, they aren't safe—they are a 'Yes Man.' You need people who will hold up a mirror and show you your blind spots. Real love is honest. Fake love is flattering. Find the person who loves you enough to tell you the truth."

**Script 4: Consistency is King**
*   **Audio:** "Stop falling for 'potential.' Look at the pattern. A safe person is consistent. Their words today match their actions tomorrow. If someone is hot and cold—obsessed with you one week and ghosting you the next—they are unsafe. Trust is built over time, not in one intense conversation. Watch the trend, not the highlight reel."

**Script 5: Grace and Truth**
*   **Audio:** "A healthy relationship needs two things: Grace and Truth. Grace means 'I love you even when you mess up.' Truth means 'I’m going to tell you when you messed up.' If you have Grace without Truth, the relationship is shallow. If you have Truth without Grace, the relationship is judgmental. You need the perfect balance to grow."
