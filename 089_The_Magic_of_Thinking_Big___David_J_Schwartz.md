**Title:** Why Small Thinking is Killing Your Dreams

**[0:00-2:00] The Size of Your Belief**
*   **Host:** "Two men work for the same company. One thinks he is worth \$50,000. The other thinks he is worth \$500,000. Guess what? They are both right. David Schwartz says the only difference between success and failure is the size of your thinking. Today we learn *The Magic of Thinking Big*."

**[2:00-5:00] The Cure for Excusitis**
*   **Host:** "Do you have 'Excusitis'? Most people do. They say: 'I'm too old,' 'I'm not lucky,' or 'I'm not smart enough.' Schwartz says these are all lies. A man with a 100 IQ who believes in himself will always beat a man with a 150 IQ who is full of excuses. Stop making excuses and start making progress."

**[5:00-7:30] How to Build Confidence**
*   **Host:** "Confidence is not a gift; it's a habit. Schwartz gives 5 exercises. 1. Be a front-seater (sit in the front row). 2. Make eye contact. 3. Walk 25% faster. 4. Speak up in meetings. 5. Smile big. These physical actions force your brain to feel confident."

**[7:30-9:00] Environment Matters**
*   **Host:** "You are a product of your environment. If you hang out with 'little' people who gossip and complain, your thinking will be little. If you hang out with big thinkers who talk about ideas and the future, your thinking will expand. Be first-class."

**[9:00-10:00] Conclusion**
*   **Host:** "Think big. Talk big. Act big. The world will follow."

## 3. Short Form Video Scripts (30-60 Seconds)

**Script 1: Intelligence doesn't Matter**
*   **Audio:** "Stop saying 'I'm not smart enough.' It’s a lie. David Schwartz found that 'Thinking' is much more important than 'Intelligence.' A man who thinks big but has average brains will always out-earn a genius who thinks small. It’s not how much brain you have; it’s how you use the brain you've got. Believe in yourself and the results will follow."

**Script 2: Action Cures Fear**
*   **Audio:** "Fear is a ghost that disappears when you walk through it. Most people wait to 'feel' confident before they act. They have it backward. Action is the cure for fear. If you are scared to make a call, make it immediately. If you are scared to start a business, do one small task today. Indecision creates fear; action destroys it."

**Script 3: Walk 25% Faster**
*   **Audio:** "Want to feel more confident in 10 seconds? Walk 25% faster. Most people walk with a 'I have nowhere to go' pace. Successful people walk with purpose. They move with energy. When you speed up your walk, you tell your brain that you are important and you have things to do. It’s a tiny physical change with a massive mental result."

**Script 4: Excusitis**
*   **Audio:** "Are you suffering from 'Excusitis'? It’s the disease of the mediocre. 'I’m too young,' 'I have bad luck,' 'The economy is bad.' Every excuse is a brick in the wall of your own prison. Successful people have the same problems, they just don't use them as excuses. Kill the excuses and you'll find the results."

**Script 5: Think 'Can'**
*   **Audio:** "The language you use determines your reality. Stop saying 'It's impossible' or 'It won't work.' Big thinkers use words that create positive mental images. Instead of saying 'Why we can't,' ask 'How can we?' When you look for a way, your brain starts finding solutions you never saw before. Change your words, change your world."
