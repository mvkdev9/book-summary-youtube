**Title:** The 4,000-Year-Old Secret to Getting Rich

**[0:00-2:00] The Ancient Wisdom**
*   **Host:** "Babylon was the wealthiest city in the ancient world. They didn't have oil or gold mines. They just had people who knew how to handle money. Today we look at the most famous finance book ever written: *The Richest Man in Babylon*."

**[2:00-5:00] Pay Yourself First**
*   **Host:** "The #1 rule is: 'A part of all I earn is mine to keep.' We pay the landlord, the grocer, and the phone company. But we never pay ourselves. You MUST save 10% of your income before you pay anything else. If you earn \$100, \$10 belongs to you. The rest belongs to the world. Start fattening your purse today."

**[5:00-7:30] Invest, Don't Gamble**
*   **Host:** "Cure #3 is: 'Make thy gold multiply.' Once you have a pile of money, don't just let it sit there. Invest it. But Cure #4 is a warning: 'Guard thy treasures from loss.' If you want to invest in jewelry, don't ask a bricklayer for advice. Ask a jeweler. Only listen to people with 'Skin in the Game' and actual expertise."

**[7:30-9:00] The Power of Skill**
*   **Host:** "Cure #7: 'Increase thy ability to earn.' The best investment you will ever make is in your own brain. If you want more money, you need more skill. The man who knows how to do a job better than anyone else will never be hungry. Be a master of your craft."

**[9:00-10:00] Conclusion**
*   **Host:** "The rules of money haven't changed in 4,000 years. Save 10%. Invest wisely. Learn more."

**Script 1: Pay Yourself First**
*   **Audio:** "You are a slave to your bills. You work 40 hours a week and at the end, you have zero dollars left. Why? Because you pay everyone else first. The Richest Man in Babylon says: 'A part of all I earn is mine to keep.' You must set aside 10% of your paycheck the second you get it. That 10% is your future freedom. Don't touch it. Pay yourself first, then live on the rest."

**Script 2: Needs vs Wants**
*   **Audio:** "Why are you broke? Probably because your 'Wants' have become your 'Needs.' You think you need the new iPhone. You think you need the Netflix subscription. The ancients taught us to 'Control thy expenditures.' Look at your budget. 90% of what you spend is just 'desire' disguised as 'necessity.' Cut the fluff and watch your wealth grow."

**Script 3: Make Your Money Work**
*   **Audio:** "Money is a worker. If it’s sitting in a savings account, it’s lazy. If it’s under your mattress, it’s dead. The Richest Man in Babylon says: 'Make thy gold multiply.' Every dollar you save should be a soldier that goes out and captures more dollars for you. Use dividends and interest to build an army of wealth. Stop working for money and start making money work for you."

**Script 4: Seek Wise Counsel**
*   **Audio:** "Never take financial advice from a broke person. It sounds obvious, but we do it all the time. The book tells a story of a man who gave his savings to a bricklayer to buy jewels. Of course, he got scammed! If you want advice on gold, ask a goldsmith. If you want advice on stocks, ask an investor. Protect your treasure by only listening to experts."

**Script 5: Invest in Yourself**
*   **Audio:** "What is the fastest way to get rich? Increase your ability to earn. You can only save so much, but you can earn an infinite amount. The ancients believed that 'The more wisdom we know, the more we may earn.' Spend 1 hour a day learning a new skill. Become the most valuable person in your office. Your brain is the most powerful wealth-building machine you own."
