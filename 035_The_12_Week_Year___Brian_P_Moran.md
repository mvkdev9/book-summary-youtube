# The 12 Week Year by Brian P. Moran

## 1. Long Detailed Summary for Blog

**Title:** Get More Done in 12 Weeks than Others Do in 12 Months: *The 12 Week Year*

**Introduction**
Most people set annual goals. Brian Moran argues this is a mistake. "Annualized thinking" leads to complacency. We think we have plenty of time in January, so we slack off until November. The solution? Redefine a "year" as 12 weeks.

**The Concept**
*   **The Periodization:** Athletes train in cycles. You should too.
*   **Urgency:** When the deadline is 12 weeks away, every week counts. There is no "slack" time.
*   **The 13th Week:** Rest and review.

**The Execution System**
1.  **Vision:** What do you want? (Long term).
2.  **Plan:** What are the tactics? (Weekly plan).
3.  **Process Control:** Weekly scorecard. Did you do the tactics?
4.  **Measurement:** Lead indicators (actions) vs. Lag indicators (results).

**Key Concepts**
*   **Weekly Execution:** You don't manage the 12 weeks. You manage the *day*.
*   **The Emotional Cycle of Change:** Uninformed Optimism -> Informed Pessimism -> Valley of Despair -> Informed Optimism -> Success.

**Conclusion**
Stop waiting for New Year's. Your year starts now.

**Title:** Why You Should Ditch Annual Goals

**[0:00-2:00] The December Rush**
*   **Host:** "Have you noticed how productive everyone is in December? Everyone is scrambling to hit their quotas before the year ends."
*   **Host:** "Brian Moran asks: 'What if we could have that December energy all year round?'"
*   **Host:** "This is *The 12 Week Year*. Forget the 12-month year. It's too long. It breeds laziness."

**[2:00-5:00] Annualized Thinking**
*   **Host:** "In January, you think 'I have plenty of time.' In March, you're behind but 'I can catch up.' By October, you panic. This is 'Annualized Thinking.' It kills urgency."
*   **Host:** "In the 12 Week Year, a week is a month. A day is a week. There is no time to procrastinate. Every day matters."

**[5:00-7:00] The Scorecard**
*   **Host:** "Most people track results (Lag indicators). 'I lost 1 pound.' Moran says track actions (Lead indicators). 'I worked out 4 times.'"
*   **Host:** "Every week, you give yourself a score. If you did 85% of your planned tactics, the results will take care of themselves."

**[7:00-9:00] The Valley of Despair**
*   **Host:** "Moran warns about the 'Valley of Despair.' Week 1 is exciting. Week 4 is hard. This is where most quit. The 12 Week system forces you to confront the reality early, not in December."

**[9:00-10:00] Conclusion**
*   **Host:** "Treat the next 12 weeks as a year. What can you achieve?"

## 3. Short Form Video Scripts (30-60 Seconds)

**Script 1: Annualized Thinking**
*   **Audio:** "Stop setting annual goals. A year is too long. In January, you feel like you have forever, so you slack off. By November, you panic. This is 'Annualized Thinking.' Shrink your timeline. Treat the next 12 weeks as your 'Year.' When the deadline is close, urgency goes up. Productivity explodes."

**Script 2: Lead vs. Lag Indicators**
*   **Audio:** "You are tracking the wrong things. Weight on the scale is a 'Lag Indicator'—it happened in the past. You can't control it directly. Workouts per week is a 'Lead Indicator.' You can control that. Focus 100% on the Lead Indicators. If you hit your workout targets, the scale will follow. Trust the process."

**Script 3: The Valley of Despair**
*   **Audio:** "Every new project goes through the 'Emotional Cycle of Change.' 1. Uninformed Optimism (This is fun!). 2. Informed Pessimism (This is hard). 3. The Valley of Despair (I want to quit). 4. Success. Most people quit in the Valley. If you know it's coming, you can push through. Don't quit in the valley."

**Script 4: A Week is a Month**
*   **Audio:** "In the 12 Week Year, a week is a month. If you have a bad week, you just had a bad month. This intensity sounds scary, but it's liberating. You get 4 'Years' in one calendar year. That means 4 chances to start fresh. 4 chances to celebrate. Compress your timeline to expand your results."

**Script 5: Execution is Everything**
*   **Audio:** "You don't have a knowledge problem; you have an execution problem. You know you should eat healthy. You know you should save money. You just aren't doing it. *The 12 Week Year* isn't about learning new things; it’s about executing what you already know. Tactics. Scorecards. Accountability."
