**Title:** 64 Simple Rules for Health (Pollan Summary)

**[0:00-2:00] The Simple Solution**
*   **Host:** "I've read 100 books on nutrition. Most of them are too long and too confusing. But Michael Pollan wrote a book that you can read in 30 minutes. It has 64 rules. And if you follow them, you'll be healthier than any biohacker. This is *Food Rules*."

**[2:00-5:00] Part 1: What to Eat**
*   **Host:** "Rule #1: **Eat Food.** Real food. If it has a mascot, it’s not food. If it has a health claim, it’s not food. If your great-grandmother wouldn't know what it is, put it back. Pollan says: 'Avoid food products containing ingredients that a third-grader cannot pronounce.' If you can't read it, your body can't digest it."

**[5:00-7:30] Part 2: Mostly Plants**
*   **Host:** "You don't need to be a vegetarian. But plants should be the star. Rule #24: 'Eat your colors.' The brighter the veggie, the better the medicine. And here is my favorite rule: **Eat all the junk food you want, as long as you cook it yourself.** If you want french fries, peel the potatoes, fry them, and clean up the mess. You won't do it every day. Laziness is a great diet plan."

**[7:30-9:00] Part 3: How to Eat**
*   **Host:** "How you eat is as important as what you eat. Rule #58: 'Do all your eating at a table.' No eating in the car. No eating while standing over the sink. No eating in front of the TV. When you are distracted, you overeat. When you sit at a table, you honor the food and your body."

**[9:00-10:00] Conclusion**
*   **Host:** "Pick 3 rules today. Start simple. Eat food. Not too much. Mostly plants."

## 3. Short Form Video Scripts (30-60 Seconds)

**Script 1: The Great-Grandmother Rule**
*   **Audio:** "The best nutritional expert in your life is your great-grandmother. Michael Pollan says: 'Don't eat anything she wouldn't recognize as food.' She knew what butter was. She would have no idea what 'Go-Gurt' or 'Protein Bars' are. If a food didn't exist 100 years ago, your body probably isn't designed to handle it. Get back to the basics."

**Script 2: The Junk Food Rule**
*   **Audio:** "Want to eat junk food? Go ahead! But there is one rule: You have to cook it yourself. If you want a double bacon cheeseburger and fries, you have to grind the meat, bake the bun, and hand-cut the potatoes. When we have to do the work, we eat junk food as a rare treat. When we can buy it for \$2 through a window, we eat it every day. Reclaim your kitchen to reclaim your health."

**Script 3: The 5-Ingredient Rule**
*   **Audio:** "How to shop like a pro? Check the ingredients. If a product has more than 5 ingredients, it’s not food—it’s a 'food-like substance.' And if it has ingredients you can't pronounce, put it back! Your body shouldn't have to solve a chemistry puzzle every time you eat lunch. If the label is long, the life is short."

**Script 4: Eat at a Table**
*   **Audio:** "Stop eating in your car. Stop eating at your desk. And definitely stop eating in front of the TV. When you eat while distracted, your brain misses the 'Full' signal. You end up eating 30% more than you need. Michael Pollan says: 'Do all your eating at a table.' When you focus on your food, you enjoy it more and eat less. Make every meal an event."

**Script 5: The Gas Station Rule**
*   **Audio:** "Never get your fuel from the same place your car does. Gas stations are for gas, not for snacks. Everything inside a gas station is designed for shelf-life, not human life. It’s packed with salt, sugar, and fat to keep it 'fresh' for a decade. If you're hungry on a road trip, wait until you find a real grocery store. Your body isn't a dumpster."
