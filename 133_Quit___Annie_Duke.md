# Quit by Annie Duke

## 1. Long Detailed Summary for Blog

**Title:** The Power of Knowing When to Walk Away: *Quit*

**Introduction**
In our culture, "quitters never win." Annie Duke argues that this advice is dangerous. Quitting is a vital skill for success. If you don't quit the wrong things, you don't have the time or energy for the right things.

**Key Insights**
1.  **Opportunity Cost:** Every minute you spend on a failing project is a minute you aren't spending on a winning one. Quitting is an investment in your future.
2.  **Sunk Cost Fallacy:** We stay in bad jobs and bad relationships because we've already "put in the time." But the time is gone whether you quit or stay.
3.  **Loss Aversion:** We hate losing more than we like winning. Quitting feels like a loss. Staying feels like "hanging in there."
4.  **Kill Criteria:** Decide *before* you start what conditions will make you quit. (e.g., "If I don't have 100 customers in 6 months, I will pivot").
5.  **Quitting Coach:** We are too close to our own problems. We need an objective outsider to tell us when to walk away.

**Conclusion**
Quitting is not a sign of weakness; it is a sign of intelligence.

**Title:** Why You Should Quit More Often (Annie Duke Summary)

**[0:00-2:00] The Quitting Myth**
*   **Host:** "Vince Lombardi said: 'Quitters never win and winners never quit.' He was wrong. Winners quit all the time. They quit the things that aren't working so they can focus on the things that are. This is Annie Duke’s *Quit*."

**[2:00-5:00] The Everest Disaster**
*   **Host:** "In 1996, 8 people died on Mt. Everest. Why? Because they reached their 'turnaround time'—the time they had to start descending to stay alive—and they kept going. They were too close to the summit. They couldn't quit. Quitting saves lives. And it saves careers."

**[5:00-7:30] Sunk Cost & Identity**
*   **Host:** "Why is quitting so hard? Because we tie our identity to our work. 'I am a lawyer.' If I quit being a lawyer, who am I? We also hate 'wasting' time. But staying in a bad job for another year is wasting *even more* time. Stop looking at the past and start looking at the future."

**[7:30-9:00] Kill Criteria**
*   **Host:** "How to quit smarter? Use **Kill Criteria**. When you start a project, write down: 'I will quit if...' Get specific. When you hit that mark, don't negotiate. Just walk away. Also, get a 'Quitting Coach'—a friend who will be brutally honest with you."

**[9:00-10:00] Conclusion**
*   **Host:** "Quitting is a choice. Use it wisely."

## 3. Short Form Video Scripts (30-60 Seconds)

**Script 1: Quitters Win**
*   **Audio:** "Stop saying 'Winners never quit.' It’s the worst advice ever given. Winners quit all the time. They quit bad jobs, bad relationships, and bad business ideas. If you don't quit the things that aren't working, you'll never have the space for the things that will. Quitting is a superpower. Use it."

**Script 2: Sunk Cost Fallacy**
*   **Audio:** "Are you staying in that job because you've been there 5 years? That is the Sunk Cost Fallacy. The 5 years are gone. You can't get them back. The only question that matters is: 'Is the *next* 5 years worth it?' Stop making decisions based on your past. Make them based on your future."

**Script 3: Opportunity Cost**
*   **Audio:** "What is the price of NOT quitting? It’s called Opportunity Cost. Every hour you spend on a dead-end project is an hour you COULD have spent on your dream. Quitting isn't 'giving up'—it’s 'moving on.' It’s freeing up your most valuable resource: your time."

**Script 4: Kill Criteria**
*   **Audio:** "Don't trust your future self to quit. You'll be too emotional. Instead, set 'Kill Criteria.' Write down exactly what has to happen for you to walk away. 'If I’m not profitable in 12 months, I’m done.' When you hit the wall, don't think—just follow the script you wrote when you were calm."

**Script 5: The Turnaround Time**
*   **Audio:** "Mountain climbers have a 'Turnaround Time.' If they aren't at the summit by 2 PM, they turn back—even if they are 10 feet away. Why? Because they want to live. In business and life, you need a turnaround time. If you don't set a limit, you'll end up 'summiting' a dead project and losing everything else."
