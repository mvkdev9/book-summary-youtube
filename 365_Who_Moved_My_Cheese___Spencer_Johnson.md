# Who Moved My Cheese? by Spencer Johnson

## 1. Long Detailed Summary for Blog

**Title:** Adapt or Die: *Who Moved My Cheese?*

**Introduction**
This is one of the best-selling business books of all time because it is deceptively simple. It’s a parable about two mice (Sniff and Scurry) and two little people (Hem and Haw) in a maze, looking for cheese. "Cheese" is a metaphor for what you want (job, relationship, money). The Maze is where you look for it.

**Core Concepts**

1.  **Change Happens:**
    *   The Cheese moves. It always moves. You can't expect things to stay the same forever.

2.  **Anticipate Change:**
    *   Sniff and Scurry (the mice) kept their running shoes around their necks. They were ready. Hem and Haw got comfortable and arrogant. When the cheese disappeared, the mice moved on immediately. The humans complained.

3.  **Let Go of Old Cheese:**
    *   Hem refused to leave. "It's not fair!" Haw eventually realized: "The quicker you let go of old cheese, the sooner you find new cheese."
    *   Holding onto the past keeps you hungry.

4.  **Enjoy the Adventure:**
    *   Movement in a new direction helps you find new cheese. Overcoming the fear of the maze is the victory.

**Conclusion**
*Who Moved My Cheese?* is a manual for survival in a fast-paced world. Don't be a Hem. Be a Scurry. Move with the cheese.

Spencer Johnson teaches us that the old cheese is never coming back. The longer you stay, the hungrier you get. Let go. Enter the maze. New cheese is waiting for you."

**Script 2: What Would You Do?**
*   **Audio:** "What would you do if you weren't afraid? That is the golden question from *Who Moved My Cheese?*. Most of the time, we stay in bad situations because we are scared of the unknown. We prefer a miserable known to a mystery. But the mystery is where the growth is. Feel the fear and run anyway."
