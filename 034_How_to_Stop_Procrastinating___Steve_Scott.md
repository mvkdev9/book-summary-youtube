**The "Why"**
We procrastinate because:

2.  **Time Blocking:** Dedicate specific hours.
3.  **The 2-Minute Rule:** (Borrowed from GTD).
4.  **Batching:** Group similar tasks.

**Key Concepts**
*   **SMART Goals:** Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, Time-bound. Vague goals breed procrastination.

**Script 1: The 5-Minute Rule**
*   **Audio:** "Dreading a task? Use the 5-Minute Rule. Tell yourself: 'I will just do this for 5 minutes. If I hate it, I can stop.' The brain can handle 5 minutes of pain. It can't handle 'Write a Thesis.' Once you start, you'll likely keep going. The hardest part is the start."

**Script 2: Don't Break the Chain**
*   **Audio:** "Jerry Seinfeld's secret to success? A wall calendar and a red marker. Every day he wrote a joke, he put a big Red X on the day. After a few days, he had a chain. 'Your only job is to not break the chain.' Visual progress is addictive. Start your chain today."

**Script 3: SMART Goals**
*   **Audio:** "Vague goals are the mother of procrastination. 'Get fit' is a wish. 'Go to the gym Monday at 7 AM' is a plan. Make your goals SMART. Specific. Measurable. Attainable. Relevant. Time-bound. If you don't know exactly what to do and when to do it, you won't do it."

**Script 4: Eat the Elephant**
*   **Audio:** "How do you eat an elephant? One bite at a time. How do you write a book? One page at a time. Procrastination often comes from overwhelm. The task looks too big. Break it down until the first step is laughably easy. 'Open Word Document.' Start there."

**Script 5: Perfectionism is Fear**
*   **Audio:** "Perfectionism is just procrastination in a fancy suit. You aren't holding out for quality; you are hiding from judgment. A messy draft is better than a perfect blank page. You can edit a bad page. You can't edit nothing. Give yourself permission to suck."
