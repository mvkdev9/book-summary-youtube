4.  **Stonewalling:** Tuning out and withdrawing from the conversation.

**The Seven Principles**
1.  **Enhance Your Love Maps:** Know your partner's world (dreams, friends, fears).
2.  **Nurture Your Fondness and Admiration:** Focus on what you like about them.
3.  **Turn Toward Each Other:** Notice their "bids" for attention and respond.
4.  **Let Your Partner Influence You:** Share power.
5.  **Solve Your Solvable Problems:** Use "Softened Startups."
6.  **Overcome Gridlock:** Understand the "Hidden Dream" behind perpetual arguments.
7.  **Create Shared Meaning:** Build a "Culture" together.

**Conclusion**
A happy marriage is based on deep friendship and mutual respect.

**Title:** How to Predict Divorce (Gottman Summary)

**[0:00-2:00] The Love Lab**
*   **Host:** "John Gottman has a lab where he watches couples talk. He monitors their heart rate, their sweat, and their facial expressions. He knows within minutes if they will survive. And today, I’m going to give you his secrets for a 50-year marriage."

**[2:00-5:00] The Four Horsemen**
*   **Host:** "Gottman says there are 4 behaviors that kill love. **Criticism** (you are a jerk), **Defensiveness** (it’s not my fault), **Stonewalling** (ignoring), and the worst one: **Contempt**. Contempt is when you look down on your partner. It’s the ultimate relationship poison. If you have these in your house, you are in the danger zone."

**[5:00-7:30] Bids for Attention**
*   **Host:** "The secret to a great marriage isn't a big vacation. It’s 'Turning Toward.' Every day, your partner makes 'Bids' for attention. They say 'Look at that bird!' or 'I'm tired.' If you look at the bird, you turned toward. If you ignore them, you turned away. Happy couples turn toward 86% of the time."

**[7:30-9:00] Love Maps**
*   **Host:** "How well do you know your partner? Who is their best friend? What is their biggest stress at work right now? What is their secret dream? Gottman calls this a 'Love Map.' If you don't update your map, you are living with a stranger. Stay curious."

**[9:00-10:00] Conclusion**
*   **Host:** "Friendship is the foundation. Turn toward your partner today."

**Script 1: Contempt kills**
*   **Audio:** "The number one predictor of divorce isn't fighting or cheating. It’s Contempt. Contempt is eye-rolling, sarcasm, and acting superior. It’s the intention to make your partner feel small. John Gottman found that contempt is actually harmful to your partner's immune system! If you want to stay married, delete the sarcasm and bring back the respect."

**Script 2: Bids for Connection**
*   **Audio:** "Your partner is constantly begging for your attention. John Gottman calls these 'Bids.' When they say 'How was your day?' or 'Look at this funny meme,' they are making a bid. You have two choices: Turn Toward (give them attention) or Turn Away (ignore them). Happy couples turn toward almost every single time. Don't miss the small moments."

**Script 3: Softened Startup**
*   **Audio:** "Fights usually end the way they begin. If you start a conversation with 'You never help around here!' (a Harsh Startup), your partner will immediately become defensive. Try a 'Softened Startup.' Say 'I’m feeling overwhelmed with the house, could you help me with the dishes?' Focus on your feeling, not their failure. Change the beginning to change the end."

**Script 4: Love Maps**
*   **Audio:** "When was the last time you updated your 'Love Map'? People change. Their favorite foods change. Their fears change. Their dreams change. If you aren't asking your partner questions every week, you are married to a memory, not a person. Stay curious. Ask them something new today. Map their soul."

**Script 5: Perpetual Problems**
*   **Audio:** "69% of relationship problems are never solved. They are perpetual. They are about differences in personality and values. Stop trying to 'fix' your partner’s core traits. Successful couples learn to live with their differences using humor and compromise. You don't need to agree on everything to be happy. You just need to be kind."
