**Title:** Negotiating Agreement Without Giving In: *Getting to Yes*

**Introduction**
Based on the work of the Harvard Negotiation Project, this book introduces "Principled Negotiation." The goal is to reach a "win-win" outcome that is fair to both sides and protects the relationship.

**The Four Principles**
1.  **Separate the People from the Problem:** Be soft on the people, but hard on the problem.
2.  **Focus on Interests, Not Positions:** Stop arguing about what you want (positions) and start talking about *why* you want it (interests). (e.g., Two people fighting over an orange; one wants the juice, the other wants the peel).
3.  **Invent Options for Mutual Gain:** Look for a bigger pie before you try to divide it.
4.  **Insist on Using Objective Criteria:** Base the result on a fair standard (market value, law, precedent) rather than a battle of wills.

**Key Concept: BATNA**
Your **Best Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement**. This is your power. If you know what you'll do if the deal fails, you can't be bullied.

**Conclusion**
Negotiation is not a war. It is a joint problem-solving exercise.

**Title:** How to Win Any Negotiation (Getting to Yes Summary)

**[0:00-2:00] The Orange Problem**
*   **Host:** "Two sisters are fighting over one orange. They finally agree to split it 50/50. One sister eats the fruit and throws away the peel. The other uses the peel for a cake and throws away the fruit. They both 'won' 50%, but they both lost 50%. This is the failure of traditional negotiation. Today we learn how to get 100% with *Getting to Yes*."

**[2:00-5:00] Interests vs Positions**
*   **Host:** "A **Position** is what you say you want. 'I want \$5000.' An **Interest** is why you want it. 'I need to pay for my kid's school.' Most people get stuck in a 'Position War.' If you stop fighting about the number and start talking about the need, you find creative solutions that make both sides happy."

**[5:00-7:30] Objective Criteria**
*   **Host:** "Don't let it become a battle of wills. If you are buying a car, don't just pick a number. Use a third party. 'What is the Kelley Blue Book value?' Use the law. Use expert opinion. When you use objective criteria, you aren't 'giving in' to the other person; you are giving in to the truth."

**[7:30-9:00] Know Your BATNA**
*   **Host:** "The most important tool in any deal is your **BATNA**. Your Best Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement. If this deal fails, what is your plan B? If your plan B is great, you have all the power. If you don't have a plan B, you are desperate. Always build your BATNA *before* you walk into the room."

**[9:00-10:00] Conclusion**
*   **Host:** "Be hard on the problem, but kind to the people. Get to yes."

## 3. Short Form Video Scripts (30-60 Seconds)

**Script 1: Position vs Interest**
*   **Audio:** "Stop arguing about 'What' you want. Start talking about 'Why' you want it. This is the difference between a Position and an Interest. Two people can both want the window open—one for fresh air, one to see the view. If you focus on the 'Why,' you can find a solution that works for both. Don't fight for a piece of the pie; bake a bigger one."

**Script 2: Separate the People**
*   **Audio:** "The person across the table is not your enemy. They are your partner in solving a problem. Roger Fisher says: 'Separate the people from the problem.' Be soft on the person—show respect and empathy—but be hard on the problem. When you stop attacking the person, they stop defending themselves and start helping you find a solution."

**Script 3: What is a BATNA?**
*   **Audio:** "The secret to negotiation power isn't a loud voice or a fancy suit. It’s your BATNA. Your Best Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement. It’s your 'Walk Away' plan. If you know you have another job offer, or another car to buy, you can't be manipulated. Before you negotiate, always strengthen your backup plan. Confidence comes from options."

**Script 4: Objective Criteria**
*   **Audio:** "Don't turn your negotiation into a playground argument. 'I want this!' 'No, I want that!' Instead, use Objective Criteria. Ask: 'What is the industry standard?' 'What does the contract say?' 'What is the fair market value?' When you base the deal on external facts, neither side feels like they lost. Logic is the ultimate mediator."

**Script 5: Win-Win is Real**
*   **Audio:** "Most people think negotiation is a zero-sum game. If you win, I lose. But *Getting to Yes* proves that Win-Win is possible. It’s not about being 'nice'; it’s about being smart. By looking for mutual gains, you build relationships that last a lifetime. A good deal is one that leaves both parties better off than they were before."
